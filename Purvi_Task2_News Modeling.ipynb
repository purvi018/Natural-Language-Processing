I owned a 1985 Toyota Celica\\nGT.  I decided to buy my elf a gift - a more exotic car.  Front runner \\nincluded the Toyota Supra Turbo and the Por che 924 (1987 model year ).\\nI narrowed it down to tho e two.  I liked the  implicity and handling\\n(and  nob appeal, too) of driving a Por che.  The Supra Turbo wa  le \\nmoney and had more feature  and performance - almo t a per onal luxury\\ncar.  It had better acceleration and a higher top  peed than the 924.\\nI wa  almo t ready to give in to a buying impul e for the 924, but i\\ndecided to  top by my in urance agent  office on the way.  I a ked\\nabout what would happen to my rate with either car.\\n \\n\"If you buy the Supra, your rate cla ification will be the  ame a \\nthe Celica (the 85 Celica wa  con idered a  ubcompact and for that\\nyear wa  rated a  one of the  afe t car ), with a  light increa e becau e\\nthe car will be 2 year  newer.  Our lower-ri k divi ion will continue\\nto handle your account.\\n \\n\"If you buy the Por che 924, well have to change you to the  tandard\\n[higher] rate company and your rate will double.  And if you go with\\na 944, it  another  tory again - well cover the re t of thi  year,\\nbut cancel you after that.\"\\n \\n\"But the Supra i  much fa ter than the 924, and the 924 i  actually\\nfa ter than the [ tandard] 944.  That doen t make  en e.\"\\n \\n That  what the book  ay .  We dont in ure Corvette , either.  For\\n ome rea on, the underwriter  con ider Supra  - and their driver  -\\na  very traditional and con ervative.\"\\n \\nI eventually went with the Supra for a number of rea on .  The Por che\\ndealer had a nice  ale man to get me intere ted, but a tough high-pre ure\\nguy in the back room.  At equal monthly payment , it would have taken\\na year longer to pay for the Por che, plu  it  higher in urance.

Jamie Navarro pitched\\n even  trong inning , but Oro co, Au tin, Manzanillo and Lloyd all took part\\nin the mockery of a bullpen ye terday. How  thi  for number ? Maldanado ha \\npitched three  corele  inning  and Navarro  ERA i  0.75. The next lowe t\\non the  taff i  Wegman at 5.14. Ouch!\\n\\nIt doe nt look much better for the hitter .

Near the end of thi  initial orbit, the Huygen \\n    Probe  eparate  from the Orbiter and de cend  through the atmo phere of\\n    Titan. The Orbiter relay  the Probe data to Earth for about 3 hour \\n    while the Probe enter  and traver e  the cloudy atmo phere to the\\n     urface. After the completion of the Probe mi ion, the Orbiter\\n    continue  touring the Saturnian  y tem for three and a half year . Titan\\n     ynchronou  orbit trajectorie  will allow about 35 flyby  of Titan and\\n    targeted flyby  of Iapetu , Dione and Enceladu . The objective  of the\\n    mi ion are threefold: conduct detailed  tudie  of Saturn  atmo phere,\\n    ring  and magneto phere; conduct clo e-up  tudie  of Saturn \\n     atellite , and characterize Titan  atmo phere and  urface.\\n\\n    One of the mo t intriguing a pect  of Titan i  the po ibility that it \\n     urface may be covered in part with lake  of liquid hydrocarbon  that\\n    re ult from photochemical proce e  in it  upper atmo phere. The e\\n    hydrocarbon  conden e to form a global  mog layer and eventually rain\\n    down onto the  urface. The Ca ini orbiter will u e onboard radar to\\n    peer through Titan  cloud  and determine if there i  liquid on the\\n     urface. Experiment  aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will\\n    inve tigate the chemical proce e  that produce thi  unique atmo phere.\\n\\n    The Ca ini mi ion i  named for Jean Dominique Ca ini (1625-1712), the\\n    fir t director of the Pari  Ob ervatory, who di covered  everal of\\n    Saturn   atellite  and the major divi ion in it  ring .

I remember that when diplomatic relation \\nbroke off between Britain and Iran over the fatwa - Iran  tre ed that\\nthe condemnation of the author, and the removal of the book from\\ncirculation were two preliminary condition  for re olving the\\n\"cri i \".

I lamic charge   uch a  fa ad are\\nlevelled at people, not book .\\n\\nThe Ru hdie  ituation wa  followed in Iran for  everal month  before the\\ni uance of the fatwa. Ru hdie went on a media blitz,\\npre enting him elf a  a lone knight guarding the  acred value  of\\n ecular democracy and mocking the fooli h concern  of people\\ncrazy enough to actually hold their religiou  belief  a   acred. \\nFanning the flame  and milking the controver y to boo t\\nhi  image and pu h the book, he wa  everywhere in the media.

Thi  allow  the thru t from the engine  to add velocity\\n\\tin the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit.  Remember:\\n\\tvelocity i  a vector quantity made of both  peed and direction.\\n\\tThe Shuttle ha  to have a large horizontal component to it \\n\\tvelocity and a very  mall vertical component to attain orbit.\\n\\n    Thi  all beg  the que tion, \"Why i nt the launch pad oriented to give\\n    thi  nice attitude to begin with?

Thi  i  an excerpt from an article featured in the fir t i ue\\nof the Copt-Net New letter :\\n\\nUnder the authority of the Ea tern Roman Empire of Con tantinople (a  oppo ed\\nto the we tern empire of Rome), the Patriarch  and Pope  of Alexandria played\\nleading role  in  Chri tian theology.  They were  invited everywhere to  peak\\nabout the Chri tian faith. St. Cyril, Pope of Alexandria, wa  the head of the\\nEcumenical Council which wa  held in Ephe u  in the year 430 A.D. It wa   aid\\nthat the bi hop  of the Church of Alexandria did nothing but  pend  all their\\ntime in meeting . Thi  leading role, however, did not fare well when politic \\n tarted to intermingle with  Church affair .  It all  tarted when the Emperor\\nMarcianu  interfered with matter  of faith in the Church. The re pon e of St.\\nDio coru , the Pope of Alexandria who wa  later  exiled, to thi  interference\\nwa  clear: \"You have nothing to do with the Church.\"  The e political motive \\nbecame even more  apparent in Chalcedon  in 451, when the Coptic  Church  wa \\nunfairly  accu ed of following  the  teaching  of  Eutyche , who believed  in\\nmonophy iti m. Thi   doctrine maintain  that the  Lord Je u  Chri t  ha  only\\none nature, the divine, not two nature , the human a  well a  the divine.\\n\\nThe Coptic  Church   ha  never  believed  in  monophy iti m  the way   it wa \\nportrayed in the Council of Chalcedon!  In  that Council, monophy iti m meant\\nbelieving in one  nature.  Copt    believe that the Lord   i  perfect in  Hi \\ndivinity,  and He   i  perfect in  Hi  humanity,  but  Hi   divinity  and Hi \\nhumanity were united in one nature called \"the nature of the incarnate word\",\\nwhich wa  reiterated by St. Cyril of Alexandria.  Copt , thu , believe in two\\nnature  \"human\" and   \"divine\"  that are   united in   one \"without mingling,\\nwithout confu ion, and without alteration\" (from the  declaration of faith at\\nthe end of the Coptic divine liturgy).  The e  two  nature  \"did not  eparate\\nfor a moment or the twinkling of an eye\" (al o from  the declaration of faith\\nat the end of the Coptic divine liturgy).\\n\\nThe  Coptic Church wa   mi under tood in the 5th century  at the  Council  of\\nChalcedon.  Perhap  the Council  under tood   the Church correctly, but  they\\nwanted to exile the  Church,   to  i olate it  and to  aboli h the  Egyptian,\\nindependent Pope. De pite  all of thi ,  the Coptic Church  ha  remained very\\n trict  and  teadfa t in it  faith.   Whether it wa    a  con piracy from the\\nWe tern Churche  to exile the Coptic Church  a  a  puni hment for it  refu al\\nto be politically influenced, or whether Pope Dio curu   didnt  quite go the\\nextra  mile to  make the  point that  Copt   are not  monophy ite, the Coptic\\nChurch ha  alway  felt a mandate  to reconcile \" emantic\" difference  between\\nall  Chri tian  Churche .   Thi  i    aptly  expre ed by the  current  117th\\n ucce or  of  St. Mark, Pope Shenouda III:  \"To the  Coptic Church, faith i \\nmore  important  than  anything, and   other   mu t know that   emantic   and\\nterminology are of  little importance to u .\"  Throughout thi   century,  the\\nCoptic Church ha  played  an important role  in the ecumenical  movement. The\\nCoptic Church i  one of the founder  of the World Council of Churche . It ha \\nremained a member of that  council   ince 1948 A.D.   The Coptic Church i   a\\nmember  of the all  African Council of Churche   (AACC)  and the  Middle Ea t\\nCouncil of  Churche  (MECC).  The Church    play  an  important role   in the\\nChri tian   movement   by   conducting dialogue    aiming  at  re olving  the\\ntheological difference  with the  Catholic, Greek Orthodox, Pre byterian, and\\nEvangelical Churche .\\n\\n[...]\\n\\nA  a final note, the Oriental Orthodox and Ea tren Orthodox did  ign\\na common  tatement of Chri tology, in which the here ey of Monophy iti m\\nwa  condemned.

Where there i   econd, however, there\\nare two; and where ther i  third, there are three.  The Spirit, then, i \\nthird from God and the Son, ju t a  the third from the root i  the fruit\\nof the  tem, and third from the fountain i  the  tream from the river,\\nand thrid from the  un i  the apex of the ray.\"\\n\\t-Tertullian, Again t Praxea , 8, 5 (about 213 AD)\\n\\nand\\n\\n\\t\"I believe that the Spirit proceed  not otherwi e than from the Father\\nthrough the Son\"\\n\\t-Tertullian, Again t Praxea , 4, 1 (about 213 AD)\\n\\nAnd a  St. Thoma   howed in hi  Summa Theologica Part 1, Que tion 36,\\nArticle  2 and 3, there i  no contradiction between the two method  of\\ngeneration, and in fact, the two method  of reckoning the proce ion\\nempha ize what St. Augu tine, among other  taught, that the Holy Spirit\\nproceed  from the Father and the Son, but He proceed  from the Father in\\na more preeminent way.\\n\\n\\t\"For whatever the Son ha , He ha  from the Father, certainly He ha  it\\nfrom the Father that the Holy Spirit proceed  from Him ...

The Son, however, i  born of the Father; and the Holy\\nSpirit proceed  principally from the Father, and  ince the Father give \\nto the Son all that He ha  without any interval of time, the Holy Spirit\\nproceed  jointly from both Father and Son.

The Spirit wa  not begotten by each,\\nhowever, but proceed  from each and both.\"\\n\\t-St. Augu tine of Hippo, The Trinity, 15, 26, 47 (400 to 416 AD)\\n\\nSo, in a  en e, all of the formulation  are correct (to the We t at\\nlea t), becau e the Holy Spirit proceed  from both Father and Son, but\\nin proceeding from the Son, the orgin of that proce ion i  the\\nproce ion from the Father,  o the Holy Spirit i  proceeding from the\\nFather through the Son, but a  all that the Son ha  i  from the Father,\\nthe Holy Spirit can be  aid to proceed from the Father, without any\\nmention of the Son being nece ary.\\n\\tIn any ca e, I am happy to know that I follow in the belief  of Pope\\nSt. Leo I, St. Fulgence of Ru pe, St. Cyril of Alexandria, Pope St.\\nDam u  I, St. Augu tine of Hippo, St. Epiphaniu  of Salami , St. Ambro e\\nof Milan, St. Hilary of Poitier , Tertullian, and other  among the\\nFather , who all have very quotable quote   upporting the Catholic\\npo ition, which I enunciated above.\\n\\tA  for the i ue of the adoption of another Creed being forbidden, I\\nwill point out that the Holy Father  of Ephe u  and Chalcedon both  poke\\nof the Creed of Nicea in their  tatement forbidding anyone \"to produce,\\nwrite, or compo e a confe ion of faith other than the one defined by\\nthe Father  of Nicea.\"  That Creed i  a different Creed than that of\\nCon tantinople, which i  commonly called the Nicene Creed.  Not of\\ncour e in that they were condemning the adoption of the\\nCon tantinopolitan Creed, which i  but an enlargement upon the Creed of\\nNicea, but that they were condemning the impiou  opinion  of Ne toriou ,\\nwho had adopted a radically different Creed from the one u ed by the\\nChurch, which among other thing  denied the proce ion of the Holy\\nSpirit form the Son.  Thu , the addition  of the Con tantinopolitan\\nCreed were not thought to be in violation of thi , and a  the Council\\nChalcedon al o affirmed the doctrine of the proce ion of the Holy\\nSpirit from the Son, which Ne toriu  denied, they could hardly have been\\nagain t explaining in a fuller way the Creed, for they them elve \\napproved of previou  addition  to it.  And if the further explanation \\nof the Creed made in Con tantinople were not denigrating of the work\\ndone by the Holy Father  of Nicea or in any way heretical, it follow \\nthat the Council of Toledo wa  fully able to add what wa  not di puted\\nby the faithful to the Creed  o a  to combat the impietie  of the Arian \\nin Spain, becau e the filioque wa  not in di pute in the Church until\\nmany year  later under Photiu  and other .  And that the filioque wa \\nnot di puted, I provide more quote  below.\\n\\n\\t\"Since the Holy Spirit when he i  in u  effect  our being conformed to\\nGod, and he actually proceed  from the Father and Son, it i  abundantly\\nclear that He i  of the divine e ence, in it in e ence and proceeding\\nfrom it.\"\\n\\t-St. Cyril of Alexandria, The Trea ury of the Holy and Con ub tantial\\nTrinity, The i  34, (423-425 AD)\\n\\n\\t\"The Holy Spirit i  not of the Father only, or of the Son only, but he\\ni  the Spirit of the Father and the Son.

You can alway   ay \"Oh, ye , youre right, it i  obviou \" when\\nyouve heard the explanation.)\\n\\nNext, the premi e  are u ed to derive further propo ition  by a proce  known\\na  inference.  In inference, one propo ition i  arrived at on the ba i  of\\none or more other propo ition  already accepted.  There are variou  form  of\\nvalid inference.\\n\\nThe propo ition  arrived at by inference may then be u ed in further\\ninference.  Inference i  often denoted by phra e   uch a  \"implie  that\" or\\n\"therefore\".\\n\\nFinally, we arrive at the conclu ion of the argument -- the propo ition which\\ni  affirmed on the ba i  of the premi e  and inference.  Conclu ion  are often\\nindicated by phra e   uch a  \"therefore\", \"it follow  that\", \"we conclude\"\\nand  o on.  The conclu ion i  often  tated a  the final  tage of inference.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nEvery event ha  a cau e (premi e)\\nThe univer e ha  a beginning (premi e)\\nAll beginning  involve an event (premi e)\\nThi  implie  that the beginning of the univer e involved an event (inference)\\nTherefore the univer e ha  a cau e (inference and conclu ion)\\n\\nNote that the conclu ion of one argument might be a premi e in another\\nargument.  A propo ition can only be called a premi e or a conclu ion with\\nre pect to a particular argument; the term  do not make  en e in i olation.\\n\\nSometime  an argument will not follow the order given above; for example,\\nthe conclu ion  might be  tated fir t and the premi e   tated \\nafterward  in  upport of the conclu ion.  Thi  i  perfectly valid, if \\n ometime  a little confu ing.\\n\\nRecognizing an argument i  much harder than recognizing premi e  or\\nconclu ion .  Many people  hower their writing with a ertion  without ever\\nproducing anything which one might rea onably de cribe a  an argument.  Some\\n tatement  look like argument , but are not.  For example:\\n\\n\"If the Bible i  accurate, Je u  mu t either have been in ane, an evil liar,\\n or the Son of God.\"\\n\\nThi  i  not an argument, it i  a conditional  tatement.  It doe  not a ert\\nthe premi e  which are nece ary to  upport what appear  to be it  \\nconclu ion.  (It al o  uffer  from a number of other logical flaw , but well\\ncome to tho e later.)\\n\\nAnother example:\\n\\n\"God created you; therefore do your duty to God.\"\\n\\nThe phra e \"do your duty to God\" i  not a propo ition,  ince it i  neither\\ntrue nor fal e.  Therefore it i  not a conclu ion, and the  entence i  not an\\nargument.\\n\\nFinally, cau ality i  important.  Con ider a  tatement of the form \"A becau e\\nB\".  If were intere ted in e tabli hing A and B i  offered a  evidence, the\\n tatement i  an argument.  If were trying to e tabli h the truth of B, then\\nit i  not an argument, it i  an explanation.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\n\"There mu t be  omething wrong with the engine of my car, becau e it will not\\n  tart.\" -- Thi  i  an argument.\\n\\n\"My car will not  tart becau e there i   omething wrong with the engine.\"\\n -- Thi  i  an explanation.\\n\\nThere are two traditional type  of argument, deductive and inductive.  A\\ndeductive argument i  one which provide  conclu ive proof of it  conclu ion \\n-- that i , an argument where if the premi e  are true, the conclu ion mu t\\nal o be true.  A deductive argument i  either valid or invalid.  A valid\\nargument i  defined a  one where if the premi e  are true, then the\\nconclu ion i  true.\\n\\nAn inductive argument i  one where the premi e  provide  ome evidence for the\\ntruth of the conclu ion.  Inductive argument  are not valid or invalid;\\nhowever, we can talk about whether they are better or wor e than other\\nargument , and about how probable their premi e  are.\\n\\nThere are form  of argument in ordinary language which are neither deductive\\nnor inductive.  However, we will concentrate for the moment on deductive\\nargument , a  they are often viewed a  the mo t rigorou  and convincing.\\n\\nIt i  important to note that the fact that a deductive argument i  valid doe \\nnot imply that it  conclu ion hold .  Thi  i  becau e of the  lightly \\ncounter-intuitive nature of implication, which we mu t now con ider more\\ncarefully.\\n\\nObviou ly a valid argument can con i t of true propo ition .  However, an\\nargument may be entirely valid even if it contain  only fal e propo ition . \\nFor example:\\n\\n   All in ect  have wing  (premi e)\\n   Woodlice are in ect  (premi e)\\n   Therefore woodlice have wing  (conclu ion)\\n\\nHere, the conclu ion i  not true becau e the argument  premi e  are fal e. \\nIf the argument  premi e  were true, however, the conclu ion would be true. \\nThe argument i  thu  entirely valid.\\n\\nMore  ubtly, we can reach a true conclu ion from one or more fal e premi e ,\\na  in:\\n\\n   All fi h live in the  ea (premi e)\\n   Dolphin  are fi h (premi e)\\n   Therefore dolphin  live in the  ea (conclu ion)\\n\\nHowever, the one thing we cannot do i  reach a fal e conclu ion through valid\\ninference from true premi e .  We can therefore draw up a \"truth table\" for\\nimplication.\\n\\nThe  ymbol \"=>\" denote  implication; \"A\" i  the premi e, \"B\" the conclu ion. \\n\"T\" and \"F\" repre ent true and fal e re pectively.\\n\\nPremi e Conclu ion Inference\\n   A        B        A=>B\\n----------------------------\\n   F        F         T      If the premi e  are fal e and the inference\\n   F        T         T      valid, the conclu ion can be true or fal e.\\n\\n   T        F         F      If the premi e  are true and the conclu ion\\n                             fal e, the inference mu t be invalid.\\n\\n   T        T         T      If the premi e  are true and the inference valid,\\n                             the conclu ion mu t be true.\\n\\nA  ound argument i  a valid argument who e premi e  are true.  A  ound \\nargument therefore arrive  at a true conclu ion.  Be careful not to confu e\\nvalid argument  with  ound argument .\\n\\nTo delve further into the  tructure of logical argument  would require\\nlengthy di cu ion of lingui tic  and philo ophy.  It i   impler and probably\\nmore u eful to  ummarize the major pitfall  to be avoided when con tructing\\nan argument.  The e pitfall  are known a  fallacie .\\n\\nIn everyday Engli h the term \"fallacy\" i  u ed to refer to mi taken belief \\na  well a  to the faulty rea oning that lead  to tho e belief .  Thi  i  fair\\nenough, but in logic the term i  generally u ed to refer to a form of\\ntechnically incorrect argument, e pecially if the argument appear  valid or\\nconvincing.\\n\\nSo for the purpo e  of thi  di cu ion, we define a fallacy a  a logical\\nargument which appear  to be correct, but which can be  een to be incorrect\\nwhen examined more clo ely.  By  tudying fallacie  we aim to avoid being\\nmi led by them.  The following li t of fallacie  i  not intended to be\\nexhau tive.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD BACULUM (APPEAL TO FORCE)\\n\\nThe Appeal to Force i  committed when the arguer re ort  to force or the\\nthreat of force in order to try and pu h the acceptance of a conclu ion.  It\\ni  often u ed by politician , and can be  ummarized a  \"might make  right\". \\nThe force threatened need not be a direct threat from the arguer.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"... Thu  there i  ample proof of the truth of the Bible.  All tho e who\\nrefu e to accept that truth will burn in Hell.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD HOMINEM\\n\\nArgumentum ad hominem i  literally \"argument directed at the man\".\\n\\nThe Abu ive variety of Argumentum ad Hominem occur  when, in tead of trying\\nto di prove the truth of an a ertion, the arguer attack  the per on or\\npeople making the a ertion.  Thi  i  invalid becau e the truth of an\\na ertion doe  not depend upon the goodne  of tho e a erting it.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"Athei m i  an evil philo ophy.  It i  practi ed by Communi t  and murderer .\"\\n\\nSometime  in a court of law doubt i  ca t upon the te timony of a witne  by \\n howing, for example, that he i  a known perjurer.  Thi  i  a valid way of\\nreducing the credibility of the te timony given by the witne , and not\\nargumentum ad hominem; however, it doe  not demon trate that the witne  \\nte timony i  fal e.  To conclude otherwi e i  to fall victim of the\\nArgumentum ad Ignorantiam ( ee el ewhere in thi  li t).\\n\\nThe circum tantial form of Argumentum ad Hominem i  committed when a per on\\nargue  that hi  opponent ought to accept the truth of an a ertion becau e of\\nthe opponent  particular circum tance .\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"It i  perfectly acceptable to kill animal  for food.  How can you argue\\notherwi e when youre quite happy to wear leather  hoe ?\"\\n\\nThi  i  an abu ive charge of incon i tency, u ed a  an excu e for di mi ing\\nthe opponent  argument.\\n\\nThi  fallacy can al o be u ed a  a mean  of rejecting a conclu ion.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"Of cour e you would argue that po itive di crimination i  a bad thing. \\nYoure white.\"\\n\\nThi  particular form of Argumentum ad Hominem, when one allege  that one \\nadver ary i  rationalizing a conclu ion formed from  elfi h intere t , i \\nal o known a  \"poi oning the well\".\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD IGNORANTIUM\\n\\nArgumentum ad ignorantium mean  \"argument from ignorance\".  Thi  fallacy\\noccur  whenever it i  argued that  omething mu t be true  imply becau e it\\nha  not been proved fal e.  Or, equivalently, when it i  argued that\\n omething mu t be fal e becau e it ha  not been proved true.  (Note that thi \\ni  not the  ame a  a uming that  omething i  fal e until it ha  been proved\\ntrue, a ba ic  cientific principle.)\\n\\nExample :\\n\"Of cour e the Bible i  true.  Nobody can prove otherwi e.\"\\n\\n\"Of cour e telepathy and other p ychic phenomena do not exi t.  Nobody ha \\n hown any proof that they are real.\"\\n\\nNote that thi  fallacy doe  not apply in a court of law, where one i \\ngenerally a umed innocent until proven guilty.\\n\\nAl o, in  cientific inve tigation if it i  known that an event would produce\\ncertain evidence of it  having occurred, the ab ence of  uch evidence can \\nvalidly be u ed to infer that the event did not occur.  For example:\\n\\n\"A flood a  de cribed in the Bible would require an enormou  volume of water\\nto be pre ent on the earth.  The earth doe  not have a tenth a  much water,\\neven if we count that which i  frozen into ice at the pole .  Therefore no\\n uch flood occurred.\"\\n\\nIn  cience, we can validly a ume from lack of evidence that  omething ha \\nnot occurred.  We cannot conclude with certainty that it ha  not occurred,\\nhowever.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD MISERICORDIAM\\n\\nThi  i  the Appeal to Pity, al o known a  Special Pleading.  The fallacy i  \\ncommitted when the arguer appeal  to pity for the  ake of getting a \\nconclu ion accepted.  For example:\\n\\n\"I did not murder my mother and father with an axe.  Plea e dont find me\\nguilty; Im  uffering enough through being an orphan.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD POPULUM\\n\\nThi  i  known a  Appealing to the Gallery, or Appealing to the People.  To\\ncommit thi  fallacy i  to attempt to win acceptance of an a ertion by\\nappealing to a large group of people.  Thi  form of fallacy i  often\\ncharacterized by emotive language.  For example:\\n\\n\"Pornography mu t be banned.  It i  violence again t women.\"\\n\\n\"The Bible mu t be true.  Million  of people know that it i .  Are you trying\\nto tell them that they are all mi taken fool ?\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NUMERAM\\n\\nThi  fallacy i  clo ely related to the argumentum ad populum.  It con i t  of\\na erting that the more people who  upport or believe a propo ition, the more\\nlikely it i  that that propo ition i  correct.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD VERECUNDIAM\\n\\nThe Appeal to Authority u e  the admiration of the famou  to try and win\\n upport for an a ertion.  For example:\\n\\n\"I aac Newton wa  a geniu  and he believed in God.\"\\n\\nThi  line of argument i  not alway  completely bogu ; for example, reference\\nto an admitted authority in a particular field may be relevant to a\\ndi cu ion of that  ubject.  For example, we can di tingui h quite clearly\\nbetween:\\n\\n\"Stephen Hawking ha  concluded that black hole  give off radiation\"\\nand\\n\"John Searle ha  concluded that it i  impo ible to build an intelligent\\n computer\"\\n\\nHawking i  a phy ici t, and  o we can rea onably expect hi  opinion  on black\\nhole radiation to be informed.  Searle i  a lingui t,  o it i  que tionable \\nwhether he i  well-qualified to  peak on the  ubject of machine intelligence.\\n\\nTHE FALLACY OF ACCIDENT\\n\\nThe Fallacy of Accident i  committed when a general rule i  applied to a\\nparticular ca e who e \"accidental\" circum tance  mean that the rule i \\ninapplicable.  It i  the error made when one goe  from the general to the\\n pecific.  For example:\\n\\n\"Chri tian  generally di like athei t .  You are a Chri tian,  o you mu t\\ndi like athei t .\"\\n\\nThi  fallacy i  often committed by morali t  and legali t  who try to decide\\nevery moral and legal que tion by mechanically applying general rule .\\n\\nCONVERSE ACCIDENT / HASTY GENERALIZATION\\n\\nThi  fallacy i  the rever e of the fallacy of accident.  It occur  when one\\nform  a general rule by examining only a few  pecific ca e  which are not\\nrepre entative of all po ible ca e .\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"Jim Bakker wa  an in incere Chri tian.  Therefore all Chri tian  are\\nin incere.\"\\n\\nSWEEPING GENERALIZATION / DICTO SIMPLICITER\\n\\nA  weeping generalization occur  when a general rule i  applied to a\\nparticular  ituation in which the feature  of that particular  ituation\\nrender the rule inapplicable.  A  weeping generalization i  the oppo ite of a\\nha ty generalization.\\n\\nNON CAUSA PRO CAUSA / POST HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\\n\\nThe e are known a  Fal e Cau e fallacie .\\n\\nThe fallacy of Non Cau a Pro Cau a occur  when one identifie   omething a  the\\ncau e of an event but it ha  not actually been  hown to be the cau e.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"I took an a pirin and prayed to God, and my headache di appeared.  So God\\ncured me of the headache.\"\\n\\nThe fallacy of Po t Hoc Ergo Propter Hoc occur  when  omething i  a umed to\\nbe the cau e of an event merely becau e it happened before the event.  For \\nexample:\\n\\n\"The Soviet Union collap ed after taking up athei m.  Therefore we mu t avoid\\nathei m for the  ame rea on .\"\\n\\nCUM HOC ERGO PROPTER HOC\\n\\nThi  fallacy i   imilar to po t hoc ergo propter hoc.  It a ert  that\\nbecau e two event  occur together, they mu t be cau ally related, and leave \\nno room for other factor  that may be the cau e( ) of the event .\\n\\nPETITIO PRINCIPII\\n\\nThi  fallacy occur  when the premi e  are at lea t a  que tionable a  the\\nconclu ion reached.\\n\\nCIRCULUS IN DEMONSTRANDO\\n\\nThi  fallacy occur  when one a ume  a  a premi e the conclu ion which one\\nwi he  to reach.  Often, the propo ition will be rephra ed  o that the\\nfallacy appear  to be a valid argument.  For example:\\n\\n\"Homo exual  mu t not be allowed to hold government office.  Hence any\\ngovernment official who i  revealed to be a homo exual will lo e hi  job. \\nTherefore homo exual  will do anything to hide their  ecret, and will be open\\nto blackmail.  Therefore homo exual  cannot be allowed to hold government\\noffice.\"\\n\\nNote that the argument i  entirely circular; the premi e i  the  ame a  the \\nconclu ion.  An argument like the above ha  actually been cited a  the rea on\\nfor the Briti h Secret Service  official ban on homo exual employee . \\nAnother example i  the cla ic:\\n\\n\"We know that God exi t  becau e the Bible tell  u   o.  And we know that the\\nBible i  true becau e it i  the word of God.\"\\n\\nCOMPLEX QUESTION / FALLACY OF INTERROGATION\\n\\nThi  i  the Fallacy of Pre uppo ition.  One example i  the cla ic loaded \\nque tion:\\n\\n\"Have you  topped beating your wife?\"\\n\\nThe que tion pre uppo e  a definite an wer to another que tion which ha  not\\neven been a ked.  Thi  trick i  often u ed by lawyer  in cro -examination,\\nwhen they a k que tion  like:\\n\\n\"Where did you hide the money you  tole?\"\\n\\nSimilarly, politician  often a k loaded que tion   uch a :\\n\\n\"How long will thi  EC interference in our affair  be allowed to continue?\"\\nor\\n\"Doe  the Chancellor plan two more year  of ruinou  privatization?\"\\n\\nIGNORATIO ELENCHI\\n\\nThe fallacy of Irrelevant Conclu ion con i t  of claiming that an argument \\n upport  a particular conclu ion when it i  actually logically nothing to do\\nwith that conclu ion.\\n\\nFor example, a Chri tian may begin by  aying that he will argue that the\\nteaching  of Chri tianity are undoubtably true.  If he then argue  at length\\nthat Chri tianity i  of great help to many people, no matter how well he\\nargue  he will not have  hown that Chri tian teaching  are true.\\n\\nSadly,  uch fallaciou  argument  are often  ucce ful becau e they arou e\\nemotion  which cau e other  to view the  uppo ed conclu ion in a more\\nfavourable light.\\n\\nEQUIVOCATION\\n\\nEquivocation occur  when a key word i  u ed with two or more different\\nmeaning  in the  ame argument.  For example:\\n\\n\"What could be more affordable than free  oftware?  But to make  ure that it\\nremain  free, that u er  can do what they like with it, we mu t place a\\nlicen e on it to make  ure that will alway  be freely redi tributable.\"\\n\\nAMPHIBOLY\\n\\nAmphiboly occur  when the premi e  u ed in an argument are ambiguou  becau e\\nof carele  or ungrammatical phra ing.\\n\\nACCENT\\n\\nAccent i  another form of fallacy through  hifting meaning.  In thi  ca e,\\nthe meaning i  changed by altering which part  of a  tatement are\\nempha ized.  For example, con ider:\\n\\n\"We  hould not  peak ILL of our friend \"\\nand\\n\"We  hould not  peak ill of our FRIENDS\"\\n\\nFALLACIES OF COMPOSITION\\n\\nOne fallacy of compo ition i  to conclude that a property  hared by the part \\nof  omething mu t apply to the whole.  For example:\\n\\n\"The bicycle i  made entirely of low ma  component , and i  therefore very \\nlightweight.\"\\n\\nThe other fallacy of compo ition i  to conclude that a property of a number\\nof individual item  i   hared by a collection of tho e item .  For example:\\n\\n\"A car u e  le  petrol and cau e  le  pollution than a bu .  Therefore car \\nare le  environmentally damaging than bu e .\"\\n\\nFALLACY OF DIVISION\\n\\nThe fallacy of divi ion i  the oppo ite of the fallacy of compo ition.  Like\\nit  oppo ite, it exi t  in two varietie .  The fir t i  to a ume that a\\nproperty of  ome thing mu t apply to it  part .  For example:\\n\\n\"You are  tudying at a rich college.  Therefore you mu t be rich.\"\\n\\nThe other i  to a ume that a property of a collection of item  i   hared by\\neach item.  For example:\\n\\n\"Ant  can de troy a tree.  Therefore thi  ant can de troy a tree.\"\\n\\nTHE SLIPPERY SLOPE ARGUMENT\\n\\nThi  argument  tate  that  hould one event occur,  o will other harmful\\nevent .  There i  no proof made that the harmful event  are cau ed by the\\nfir t event.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\"If we legalize marijuana, then we would have to legalize crack and heroin\\nand well have a nation full of drug-addict  on welfare.  Therefore we cannot\\nlegalize marijuana.\"\\n\\n\"A IS BASED ON B\" FALLACIES / \"IS A TYPE OF\" FALLACIES\\n\\nThe e fallacie  occur when one attempt  to argue that thing  are in  ome way\\n imilar without actually  pecifying in what way they are  imilar.\\n\\nExample :\\n\"I nt hi tory ba ed upon faith?  If  o, then i nt the Bible al o a form of\\nhi tory?\"\\n\\n\"I lam i  ba ed on faith, Chri tianity i  ba ed on faith,  o i nt I lam a\\nform of Chri tianity?\"\\n\\n\"Cat  are a form of animal ba ed on carbon chemi try, dog  are a form of\\nanimal ba ed on carbon chemi try,  o arent dog  a form of cat?\"\\n\\nAFFIRMATION OF THE CONSEQUENT\\n\\nThi  fallacy i  an argument of the form \"A implie  B, B i  true, therefore A\\ni  true\".  To under tand why it i  a fallacy, examine the truth table for\\nimplication given earlier.\\n\\nDENIAL OF THE ANTECEDENT\\n\\nThi  fallacy i  an argument of the form \"A implie  B, A i  fal e, therefore B\\ni  fal e\".  Again, the truth table for implication make  it clear why thi  i \\na fallacy.\\n\\nNote that thi  fallacy i  different from Non Cau a Pro Cau a; the latter ha \\nthe form \"A implie  B, A i  fal e, therefore B i  fal e\", where A doe  NOT in\\nfact imply B at all.  Here, the problem i  not that the implication i \\ninvalid; rather it i  that the fal ene  of A doe  not allow u  to deduce\\nanything about B.\\n\\nCONVERTING A CONDITIONAL\\n\\nThi  fallacy i  an argument of the form \"If A then B, therefore if B then A\".\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD ANTIQUITAM\\n\\nThi  i  the fallacy of a erting that  omething i  right or good  imply\\nbecau e it i  old, or becau e \"that  the way it  alway  been.\"\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NOVITAM\\n\\nThi  i  the oppo ite of the argumentum ad antiquitam; it i  the fallacy of\\na erting that  omething i  more correct  imply becau e it i  new or newer\\nthan  omething el e.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD CRUMENAM\\n\\nThe fallacy of believing that money i  a criterion of correctne ; that tho e\\nwith more money are more likely to be right.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD LAZARUM\\n\\nThe fallacy of a uming that becau e  omeone i  poor he or  he i   ounder or\\nmore virtuou  than one who i  wealthier.  Thi  fallacy i  the oppo ite of the\\nargumentum ad crumenam.\\n\\nARGUMENTUM AD NAUSEAM\\n\\nThi  i  the incorrect belief that an a ertion i  more likely to be true the\\nmore often it i  heard.  An \"argumentum ad nau eum\" i  one that employ \\ncon tant repetition in a erting  omething.\\n\\nBIFURCATION\\n\\nAl o referred to a  the \"black and white\" fallacy, bifurcation occur  when\\none pre ent  a  ituation a  having only two alternative , where in fact other\\nalternative  exi t or can exi t.\\n\\nPLURIUM INTERROGATIONUM / MANY QUESTIONS\\n\\nThi  fallacy occur  when a que tioner demand  a  imple an wer to a complex\\nque tion.\\n\\nNON SEQUITUR\\n\\nA non- equitur i  an argument where the conclu ion i  drawn from premi e \\nwhich are not logically connected with it.\\n\\nRED HERRING\\n\\nThi  fallacy i  committed when irrelevant material i  introduced to the i ue\\nbeing di cu ed,  o that everyone  attention i  diverted away from the\\npoint  being made, toward  a different conclu ion.\\n\\nREIFICATION / HYPOSTATIZATION\\n\\nReification occur  when an ab tract concept i  treated a  a concrete thing.\\n\\nSHIFTING THE BURDEN OF PROOF\\n\\nThe burden of proof i  alway  on the per on making an a ertion or\\npropo ition.  Shifting the burden of proof, a  pecial ca e of argumentum ad\\nignorantium, i  the fallacy of putting the burden of proof on the per on who\\ndenie  or que tion  the a ertion being made.  The  ource of the fallacy i \\nthe a umption that  omething i  true unle  proven otherwi e.\\n\\nSTRAW MAN\\n\\nThe  traw man fallacy i  to mi repre ent  omeone el e  po ition  o that it\\ncan be attacked more ea ily, then to knock down that mi repre ented po ition,\\nthen to conclude that the original po ition ha  been demoli hed.  It i  a\\nfallacy becau e it fail  to deal with the actual argument  that have been\\nmade.\\n\\nTHE EXTENDED ANALOGY\\n\\nThe fallacy of the Extended Analogy often occur  when  ome  ugge ted general\\nrule i  being argued over.  The fallacy i  to a ume that mentioning two \\ndifferent  ituation , in an argument about a general rule, con titute  a \\nclaim that tho e  ituation  are analogou  to each other.\\n\\nThi  fallacy i  be t explained u ing a real example from a debate about \\nanti-cryptography legi lation:\\n\\n\"I believe it i  alway  wrong to oppo e the law by breaking it.\"\\n\\n\"Such a po ition i  odiou : it implie  that you would not have  upported\\n Martin Luther King.\"\\n\\n\"Are you  aying that cryptography legi lation i  a  important a  the\\n  truggle for Black liberation?  How dare you!\"\\n\\nTU QUOQUE\\n\\nThi  i  the famou  \"you too\" fallacy.  It occur  when an action i  argued to\\nbe acceptable becau e the other party ha  performed it.

Such community a ociation  had been \\nactive until 1984. But they were fir t told to remove\\nthe word Turki h on their building  and on their official\\npaper  and then eventually clo e down.

The fact that the Greek government  al o mention the \\nexi tence of a few thou and non-Turki h Mu lim  doe  not change the \\ne ential reality that there live  in We tern Thrace a much bigger \\nTurki h minority. The Pomak  are al o a Mu lim people, whom all the \\nthree nation  (Bulgarian , Turk , and Greek ) con ider a  part of \\nthem elve . Do you know how the Mu lim Turki h minority wa  organized \\naccording to the agreement ? Poor Poly.\\n\\nIt al o prove  that the Turki h people are trapped in Greece \\nand the Greek people are free to  ettle anywhere in the world.\\nThe Greek authoritie  deny even the exi tence of a Turki h\\nminority. They pur ue the  ame denial in connection with \\nthe Macedonian  of Greece. Talk about oppre ion. In addition,\\nin 1980 the democratic Greek Parliament pa ed Law No. 1091,\\nvirtually taking over the admini tration of the vakiflar and\\nother charitable tru t .

Talk about democracy.\\n\\nThe government of Greece ha  recently de troyed an I lamic \\nconvention in Komotini.

We will a ume you mean a NASA a tronaut,  ince it  probably\\n    impo ible for a non-Ru ian to get into the co monaut corp  (paying\\n    pa enger  are not profe ional co monaut ), and the other nation  have\\n     o few a tronaut  (and fly even fewer) that youre better off hoping to\\n    win a lottery.

So you want to become a  huttle \"mi ion\\n     peciali t\".\\n\\n    If you arent a US citizen, become one; that i  a mu t.  After that,\\n    the crucial thing to remember i  that the demand for  uch job  va tly\\n    exceed  the  upply.  NASA  problem i  not finding qualified people,\\n    but thinning the lineup down to manageable length.\\tIt i  not enough\\n    to be qualified; you mu t avoid being *di *qualified for any rea on,\\n    many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job.\\n\\n    Get a Ph.D.  Specialize in  omething that involve  getting your hand \\n    dirty with equipment, not ju t paper and pencil.  Forget computer\\n    programming entirely; it will be done from the ground for the fore-\\n     eeable future.  Degree( ) in one field plu  work experience in\\n    another  eem  to be a frequent winner.\\n\\n    Be in good phy ical condition, with good eye ight.\\t(DO NOT get a\\n    radial keratomy or  imilar hack to improve your vi ion; nobody know \\n    what  udden pre ure change  would do to RKed eye , and long-term\\n    effect  are poorly under tood.  For that matter, avoid any other\\n     ignificant medical unknown .)

(And, al o, that you\\n    will be a credit to NASA after you are hired:  public relation  i \\n    a  ignificant part of the job, and NASA  image i  very prim and\\n    proper.)  The image you want i   queaky-clean workaholic yuppie.\\n    Remember al o that you will need a  ecurity clearance at  ome point,\\n    and Security con ider  everybody guilty until proven innocent.\\n    Keep your no e clean.\\n\\n    Get a pilot  licen e and make flying your number one hobby;\\n    experienced pilot  are known to be favored even for non-pilot job .\\n\\n    Work for NASA; of 45 a tronaut   elected between 1984 and 1988,\\n    43 were military or NASA employee , and the remaining two were\\n    a NASA con ultant and Mae Jemi on (the fir t black female a tronaut).\\n    If you apply from out ide NASA and mi , but they offer you a job\\n    at NASA, ***TAKE IT***;  ometime  in the pa t thi  ha  meant \"you\\n    do look intere ting but we want to know you a bit better fir t\".\\n\\n    Think  pace:  they want highly motivated people,  o lo e no chance\\n    to demon trate motivation.\\n\\n    Keep trying.

On the 10th I had got my crew, done the paper-\\nwork, and left for the Zhdanov Di trict. That  in Azerbaijan, near the\\nNagorno Karabagh region.\\n\\nAfter the 14th, rumor   tarted to the effect that in Karabagh,  pecifically\\nin Stepanakert, an upri ing had taken place. They  aid \"upri ing\" in\\nAzerbaijani, but I dont think it wa  really an upri ing, ju t a \\ndemon tration. After that the unre t  tarted. Several Armenian  living in the \\nZhdanov Di trict were injured. How were they injured? They were beaten, even \\nwomen; it wa   aid that they were at the demon tration , but they live here, \\nand went from here to Karabagh to demon trate. After that I felt unea y. There\\nwere  ome conver ation  about Armenian  among the local population: the\\nArmenian  had done thi , the Armenian  had done that. Right there at the  ite.\\nI wa  attacked a couple of time  by kid . Well true, the guy  from my crew \\nwouldnt let them come at me with cable  and knive . After that I felt really \\nbad. I didnt know where to go. I up and called home. And my children tell me,\\n\"There  unre t everywhere, be careful.\" Well I had a project going on. I told\\nthe Second Secretary of the Di trict Party Committee what had been going on \\nand  aid I wanted to take my crew off the  ite. They wouldnt allow it, they \\n aid, \"Nothing  going to happen to you, weve entru ted the matter to the \\npolice, weve warned everyone in the di trict, nothing will happen to you.\" \\nWell, in fact they did e pecially detail u  a policeman to look after me, he \\nknow  all the local people and would protect me if  omething happened. Thi \\nman didnt leave me alone for five minute : he wa  at work the whole time and \\nafterward he  pent the night with u , too.\\n\\nI  en e  ome di quiet and call home; my wife al o tell  me, \"The  ituation i \\nvery ten e, be careful.\"\\n\\nWe fini hed the job at the  ite, and I left for Sumgait fir t thing on the\\nmorning of the 29th. When we left the guy  warned me, they told me that I\\n houldnt tell anyone on the way that I wa  an Armenian. I took  omeone el e \\nbu ine  travel document , in the name of Zardali, and hid my own. I hid it \\nand my pa port in my  ock . We  et out for Baku. Our guy  were on the bu , \\nthey  at behind, and I  at up front. In Baku they had come to me and  aid that\\nthey had to collect all of our travel document  ju t in ca e. A  it turn  out \\nthey knew what wa  happening in Sumgait.\\n\\nI arrive at the bu   tation and there they tell me that the city of Sumgait i \\nclo ed, there i  no way to get there. That the city i  clo ed off and the \\nbu e  arent running. Bu e  normally leave Baku for Sumgait almo t every two\\nminute . And  uddenly--no bu e . Well, we tried to get there via private\\ndriver . One man, an Azerbaijani,  aid, \"Let  go find  ome other way to get\\nthere.\" They found a light tran port vehicle and arranged for the driver to\\ntake u  to Sumgait.\\n\\nHe took u  there. But the other  had  aid, \"I wouldnt go if you gave me a\\nthou and ruble .\" \"Why?\" \"Becau e theyre burning the city and killing the\\nArmenian . There i nt an Armenian left.\" Well I got hold of my elf  o I could\\n till  tand up. So we  quared it away, the four of u  got in the car, and we \\n et off for Sumgait. On the way the driver  ay , \"In fact there arent any\\nArmenian  left. They burned them all, beat them all, and  tabbed them.\" Well \\nI wa   ilent. The whole way--20-odd mile --I wa   ilent. The driver a k  me, \\n\"How old are you, old man?\" He want  to know: if Im being that quiet, not \\n aying anything, maybe it mean  Im an Armenian. \"How old are you?\" he a k  \\nme. I  ay, \"Im 47.\" \"Im 47 too, but I call you old man.\" I  ay, \"It \\ndepend  on God, each per on  life in thi  world i  different.\" I look much\\nolder than my year , that  why he called me old man. Well after that he wa \\n ilent, too.\\n\\nWere approaching the city, I look and  ee tank  all around, and a cordon.\\nBefore we get to the Kavkaz  tore the driver  tart  to wave hi  hand. Well, he\\nwa  waving hi  hand, we all  tart waving our hand . Im  itting there with\\nthem, I  tart waving my hand, too. I realized that thi  wa  a  ign that meant\\nthere were no Armenian  with u .\\n\\nI look at the city--there i  a crowd of people walking down the middle of the \\n treet, you know, and there  no traffic. Well probably I wa   cared. They\\n topped our car. People were  tanding on the  idewalk . They have armature \\n haft , and  tone  . . . And they  topped u  . . .\\n\\nAlong the way the driver tell  u  how they know who  an Armenian and who  \\nnot. The Armenian  u ually . . . For example, Im an Armenian, but I  peak \\ntheir language very well. Well Armenian  u ually pronounce the Azeri word for \\n\"nut,\" or \"little nut,\" a  \"pundukh,\" but \"fundukh\" i  actually correct. The \\npronunciation  are different. Anyone who  ay  \"pundukh,\" even if theyre not \\nArmenian, they immediately take out and  tart to  la h. Another one  ay , \\n\"There wa  a car there, with five people in ide it,\" he  ay . \"They  tarted \\nhitting the  ide of it with an axe and lit it on fire. And they didnt let the\\npeople out,\" he  ay , \"they wouldnt let them get out of the car.\" I only  aw \\nthe car, but the driver  ay  that he  aw everything. Well he often drive  from\\nBaku to Sumgait and back . . .\\n\\nWhen they  top u  we all get out of the car. I look and there  a  hort guy,\\nhi  eye  are gleaming, he ha  an armature  haft in one hand and a  tone in\\nthe other and a k  the guy  what nationality they are one by one. \"Were\\nAzerbaijani, they tell him, no Armenian  here.\" He did come up to me when \\nwe were pulling our thing  out and  ay , \"Maybe youre an Armenian, old man?\" \\nBut in Azerbaijani I  ay, \"You  hould be a hamed of your elf!\" And . . . he \\nleft. Turned and left. That wa  all that happened. What wa  I to do? I had \\nto . . . the city wa  on fire, but I had to  teal my children out of my own \\nhome.\\n\\nThey  topped u  at the entrance to Mir Street, that  where the Kavkaz  tore \\nand three large, 12- tory building  are. That  the beginning of down-town. I \\n aw that burned automobile there, completely burned, only metal remained. I \\ncouldnt figure out if it wa  a Zhiguli or a Zaporozhet . Later I wa  told it \\nwa  a Zhiguli. And the people in there were completely incinerated. Nothing \\nremained of them, not even any trace . That driver had told me about it, and I\\n aw the car my elf. The car wa  there. The  keleton, a metallic carca . About\\n30 to 40 yard  from the Kavkaz  tore.\\n\\nI  ee a military tran port, an armored per onnel carrier. The hatche  are\\nclo ed. And people are throwing armature  haft  and piece  of iron at it, the\\ncrowd i . And I hear  hot , not automatic fire, it  true, but pi tol  hot .\\nSeveral  hot . There were Azerbaijani  crowded around that per onnel carrier. \\nSomeone in the crowd wa   hooting. Apparently they either wanted to kill the \\n oldier  or get a machine gun or  omething. At that point there wa  only one \\narmored per onnel carrier. And all the tank  were out ide the city, cordoning \\noff Sumgait.\\n\\nI walked on. I  ee two Azerbaijani  going home from the plant. I can tell by \\ntheir gait that theyre not bandit , theyre ju t people, walking home. I\\njoined them  o in ca e  omething happened, in ca e  omeone came up to u \\nand a ked que tion , either of u  would be in a po ition to an wer, you  ee.\\nBut I avoided the large group  becau e Im a local and might be quickly \\nrecognized. I tried to keep at a di tance, and walked where there were fewer\\npeople. Well  o I walked into Microdi trict 2, which i  acro  from our block.\\nI cant get into our block, but I walked where there were fewer people,  o a  \\nto get around. Well there I  ee a tall guy and 25 to 30 people are walking \\nbehind him. And he   houting into a megaphone: \"Comrade , the Armenian-\\nAzerbaijani war ha  begun!\"\\n\\nThe police have megaphone  like that. So theyre talking and walking around \\nthe  econd microdi trict. I  ee that theyre coming my way, and turn off \\nbehind a building.

Chri t incarnated only once in the\\nfle h, and in that he had no debt of karma or  in.

It i  the\\ntenth chapter of John, devoted almo t entirely to the man born blind.\\nClearly here, Je u  tell  the di ciple  that it wa  not hi  pa t karma\\nor that of hi  parent  that led to hi  blindne , but rather that a\\nnew impul e i  to be revealed through him.

The fact that they even a ked about the fir t po ibility at\\nall indicate  an awarene  of the idea on their part and the form of\\nChri t  an wer indicate  that he did not di agree with it.\\n\\nThere i  al o Matthew 11:14, where Je u   ay   traight out about John\\nthe Bapti t,\\n\\n   \"If you care to accept it, he him elf i  Elia , who wa  to come.\"\\n\\nThi  al o empha ize  that the Go pel  do not have a po itive teaching\\neither way about reincarnation -- or, in fact, about what happen  to\\nthe human being at all between death and the La t Day.  Even Je u  did\\nnot pu h thi  teaching on people who were not ready to embrace it (\"If\\nyou care to accept it\").  So I took care to point out, not that the\\nBible teache  reincarnation but that it doe  not deny it either, and\\nthat much in both  cripture and fundamental Chri tian doctrine become \\nunder tandable if reincarnation i  under tood in the right way.

To  tart with, line  and\\npolygon  are  emi-algebraic  et  which both contain uncountable number of\\npoint .  Here are a few off-the-cuff idea .\\n\\nFir t, we need to check if the line and the polygon are  eparated.  Now, the\\nJordan curve  eparation theorem  ay  that the polygon divide  the plane into\\nexactly two open (and thu  non-compact) region .  Thu , the line lie \\ncompletely in ide the polygon, the line lie  completely out ide the polygon,\\nor po ibly (but thi  will rarely happen) the line inter ect  the polyon.\\n\\nNow, the phra ing of thi  que tion  ay  \"if a line inter ect  a polygon\",  o\\nthi  i  a deci ion problem.  One po ibility (the deci ion model approach) i \\nto reduce the que tion to  ome other (well known) problem Q, and then try to\\n olve Q.  An an wer to Q give  an an wer to the original deci ion problem.\\n\\nIn recent year , many geometric problem  have been  ucce fully modeled in a\\nnew language called Po tScript.  (See \"Po tScript Language\", by Adobe Sy tem \\nIncorporated, ISBN # 0-201-10179-3, co. 1985).\\n\\nSo, given a line L and a polygon P, we can write a Po tScript program that\\ndraw  the line L and the polygon P, and then \"output \" the an wer.  By\\n\"output\", we mean the program execute  a command called \" howpage\", which\\nactually print  a page of paper containing the line and the polygon.  A quick\\nexamination of the paper provide  an an wer to the reduced problem Q, and thu \\nthe original problem.\\n\\nThere are two  mall problem  with thi  approach. \\n\\n\\t(1) There i  an infinite number of way  to encode L and P into the\\n\\treduced problem Q.

Wa hington \\n     On January 13, 1993, a phy ician reported to the Wa hington Department of \\nHealth a clu ter of children with hemolytic uremic  yndrome (HUS) and an \\nincrea e in emergency room vi it  for bloody diarrhea. During January 16-17, a \\nca e-control  tudy comparing 16 of the fir t ca e  of bloody diarrhea or \\npo tdiarrheal HUS identified with age- and neighborhood-matched control  \\nimplicated eating at chain A re taurant  during the week before  ymptom on et \\n(matched odd  ratio OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=3.5). On January \\n18, a multi tate recall of unu ed hamburger pattie  from chain A re taurant  \\nwa  initiated. \\n     A  a re ult of publicity and ca e-finding effort , during January-\\nFebruary 1993, 602 patient  with bloody diarrhea or HUS were reported to the \\n tate health department. A total of 477 per on  had illne e  meeting the ca e \\ndefinition of culture-confirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection or po tdiarrheal HUS \\n(Figure 1). Of the 477 per on , 52 (11%) had clo e contact with a per on with \\nconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection during the week preceding on et of \\n ymptom . Of the remaining 425 per on , 372 (88%) reported eating in a chain A \\nre taurant during the 9 day  preceding on et of  ymptom . Of the 338 patient  \\nwho recalled what they ate in a chain A re taurant, 312 (92%) reported eating \\na regular- ized hamburger patty. On et  of illne  peaked from January 17 \\nthrough January 20. Of the 477 ca epatient , 144 (30%) were ho pitalized; 30 \\ndeveloped HUS, and three died. The median age of patient  wa  7.5 year  \\n(range: 0-74 year ). Idaho \\n     Following the outbreak report from Wa hington, the Divi ion of Health, \\nIdaho Department of Health and Welfare, identified 14 per on  with culture-\\nconfirmed E. coli O157:H7 infection, with illne  on et date  from December \\n11, 1992, through February 16, 1993 (Figure 2A). Four per on  were \\nho pitalized; one developed HUS. During the week preceding illne  on et, 13 \\n(93%) had eaten at a chain A re taurant. California \\n     In late December, the San Diego County Department of Health Service  wa  \\nnotified of a child with E. coli O157:H7 infection who  ub equently died. \\nActive  urveillance and record review then identified eight other per on  with \\nE. coli O157:H7 infection  or HUS from mid-November through mid-January 1993. \\nFour of the nine reportedly had recently eaten at a chain A re taurant and \\n\\nHICNet Medical New letter                                              Page  5\\nVolume  6, Number 10                                           April 20, 1993\\n\\nfour at a chain B re taurant in San Diego. After the Wa hington outbreak wa  \\nreported, review  of medical record  at five ho pital  revealed an overall 27% \\nincrea e in vi it  or admi ion  for diarrhea during December 1992 and January \\n1993 compared with the  ame period 1 year earlier. A ca e wa  defined a  \\npo tdiarrheal HUS, bloody diarrhea that wa  culture negative or not cultured, \\nor any diarrheal illne  in which  tool culture yielded E. coli O157:H7, with \\non et from November 15, 1992, through January 31, 1993. \\n     Illne e  of 34 patient  met the ca e definition (Figure 2B). The \\noutbreak  train wa  identified in  tool  pecimen  of  ix patient . Fourteen \\nper on  were ho pitalized,  even developed HUS, and one child died. The median \\nage of ca e-patient  wa  10 year  (range: 1-58 year ). A ca e-control  tudy of \\nthe fir t 25 ca e-patient  identified and age- and  ex-matched community \\ncontrol  implicated eating at a chain A re taurant in San Diego (matched \\nOR=13; 95% confidence interval CI=1.7-99). A  tudy comparing ca e-patient  \\nwho ate at chain A re taurant  with well meal companion  implicated regular-\\n ized hamburger pattie  (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence limit=1.3). \\nChain B wa  not  tati tically a ociated with illne . Nevada \\n     On January 22, after receiving a report of a child with HUS who had eaten \\nat a local chain A re taurant, the Clark County (La  Vega ) Health Di trict \\ni ued a pre  relea e reque ting that per on  with recent bloody diarrhea \\ncontact the health department. A ca e wa  defined a  po tdiarrheal HUS, bloody \\ndiarrhea that wa  culture negative or not cultured, or any diarrheal illne  \\nwith a  tool culture yielding the Wa hington  train of E. coli O157:H7, with \\non et from December 1, 1992, through February 7, 1993. Becau e local \\nlaboratorie  were not u ing  orbitol MacConkey (SMAC) medium to  creen  tool  \\nfor E. coli O157:H7, thi  organi m wa  not identified in any patient. After \\nSMAC medium wa  di tributed, the outbreak  train wa  detected in the  tool of \\none patient 38 day  after illne  on et. \\n     Of 58 per on  who e illne e  met the ca e definition (Figure 2C), nine \\nwere ho pitalized; three developed HUS. The median age wa  30.5 year  (range: \\n0-83 year ). Analy i  of the fir t 21 patient  identified and age- and  ex-\\nmatched community control  implicated eating at a chain A re taurant during \\nthe week preceding illne  on et (matched OR=undefined; lower confidence \\nlimit=4.9). A ca e-control  tudy u ing well meal companion  of ca e-patient  \\nal o implicated eating hamburger  at chain A (matched OR=6.0; 95% CI=0.7-\\n49.8). Other Inve tigation Finding  \\n     During the outbreak, chain A re taurant  in Wa hington linked with ca e  \\nprimarily were  erving regular- ized hamburger pattie  produced on November \\n19, 1992;  ome of the  ame meat wa  u ed in \"jumbo\" pattie  produced on \\nNovember 20, 1992.

Illne  u ually re olve  after 6-8 day , but 2%-7% of patient  \\ndevelop HUS, which i  characterized by hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, \\nrenal failure, and a death rate of 3%-5%. \\n     Thi  report illu trate  the difficultie  in recognizing community \\noutbreak  of E. coli O157:H7 in the ab ence of routine  urveillance. De pite \\nthe magnitude of thi  outbreak, the problem may not have been recognized in \\nthree  tate  if the epidemiologic link had not been e tabli hed in Wa hington \\n(1). Clinical laboratorie   hould routinely culture  tool  pecimen  from \\nper on  with bloody diarrhea or HUS for E. coli O157:H7 u ing SMAC agar (5). \\nWhen infection  with E. coli O157:H7 are identified, they  hould be reported \\nto local health department  for further evaluation and, if nece ary, public \\nhealth action to prevent further ca e . \\n     E. coli O157:H7 live  in the inte tine  of healthy cattle, and can \\ncontaminate meat during  laughter. CDC i  collaborating with the U.S. \\nDepartment of Agriculture  Food Safety In pection Service to identify \\ncritical control point  in proce ing a  a component of a program to reduce \\nthe likelihood of pathogen   uch a  E. coli O157:H7 entering the meat  upply. \\nBecau e  laughtering practice  can re ult in contamination of raw meat with \\npathogen , and becau e the proce  of grinding beef may tran fer pathogen  \\nfrom the  urface of the meat to the interior, ground beef i  likely to be \\ninternally contaminated. The optimal food protection practice i  to cook \\nground beef thoroughly until the interior i  no longer pink, and the juice  \\nare clear. In thi  outbreak, undercooking of hamburger pattie  likely played \\nan important role. The Food and Drug Admini tration (FDA) ha  i ued interim \\nrecommendation  to increa e the internal temperature for cooked hamburger  to \\n155 F (86.1 C) (FDA, per onal communication, 1993). \\n     Regulatory action   timulated by the outbreak de cribed in thi  report \\nand the recovery of thou and  of contaminated pattie  before they could be \\ncon umed empha ize the value of rapid public health inve tigation  of \\noutbreak .

Particularly if a Republican admini tration had been\\nbehind it.

That put  me firmly in the amateur rank .  Thi  AMATEUR\\nknow  that the fir t thing to do when  izing up the opponent i  to do a\\np ychological profile on him.  You can bet your a  the FBI had\\nprofe ionally done profile  on Kore h.  Kore h  behavior wa \\nemminently predictable.  It i  typical of people who move away from\\ncivilization to be willing to fight to the death to pre erve their\\ni olation.  It would al o be typical, given Kore h  religiou \\norientation, for  uch an individual to interpret a government a ault a \\nthe apocalyp e.  Suicide i  a  an acceptable alternative to being\\ncon umed in the apocalyp e.\\n\\nIMHO, the FBI knew all thi  and decided after 50 day  of concentrated\\np y-op  to initiate that apocalyp e.  I believe they cho e a cour e of\\naction de igned  pecifically to pu h Kore h over the edge while publicly\\nappearing to be acting rea onably.  They KNEW that Kore h con idered the\\ntank  to be the Chariot  of Fire mentioned in the Book of Revelation .\\nThey KNEW that  ending tank , oop , combat engineering vehicle ,\\nob ten ibly to perform \"ga  in ertion \" (love that NewSpeak) WOULD pu h\\nhim over the edge.\\n\\nLook at  ome  upporting evidence.  Kore h  attorney mentioned on TV\\nearlier today (4/20) that one of Kore h  major concern wa  the biblical\\nrole of the tank   tationed around the compound.  The FBI (through Reno\\non Larry King la t night and at the new  conference thi  morning)\\nclaimed to have li tening device  in the compound.  If that wa  true\\nthey KNEW their action  were driving him to the brink.  They KNEW they\\nwere pu hing the Davidian  toward ma   uicide.  Any rational and\\nrea onable agency NOT intere ted in killing tho e people would, at\\nthe fir t  ign of preparation  for  uicide, have pulled completely back and\\nwould have gotten rid of all the armor.  In tead they continued with the\\n\"ga  in ertion\" right up to the point where flame  appeared.  The image\\nthat will remain etched in my mind i  that of the tank  trutting back\\nand forth in front of the burning compound, gloating over the kill.\\n\\nLet   tep back and a e  how thi  thing could have been ended without\\nblood hed.  Thi  technique would have required a law enforcement agency\\nintere ted in con titutionally enforcing the law and in the pre ervation\\nof life in tead of achieving a military victory and of vengence.\\n\\nThe way to have nabbed Kore h wa   imply to have announced a pull back,\\nabandoned the a ault, torn down the concertina wire and removed the\\narmor, maintained covert  urveillance of the compound and then exploited\\nhi  ego to flu h him out.

A\\n imple invite or two from the tabloid talk  how  to come on TV and tell\\nhow he whipped the US government would have been  omething he could not\\nhave re i ted.

The NSA probably po e e  cryptographic experti e many\\n  year  ahead of the public  tate of the art, and can undoubtedly break\\n  many of the  y tem  u ed in practice; but for rea on  of national\\n   ecurity almo t all information about the NSA i  cla ified.\\n\\n  Bamford  book [BAMFD] give  a hi tory of the people and operation  of\\n  the NSA. The following quote from Ma ey [MAS88] highlight  the\\n  difference between public and private re earch in cryptography:\\n\\n  ``... if one regard  cryptology a  the prerogative of government,\\n  one accept  that mo t cryptologic re earch will be conducted\\n  behind clo ed door . Without doubt, the number of worker  engaged\\n  today in  uch  ecret re earch in cryptology far exceed  that of\\n  tho e engaged in open re earch in cryptology. For only about 10\\n  year  ha  there in fact been wide pread open re earch in\\n  cryptology. There have been, and will continue to be, conflict \\n  between the e two re earch communitie . Open re earch i  common\\n  que t for knowledge that depend  for it  vitality on the open\\n  exchange of idea  via conference pre entation  and publication  in\\n   cholarly journal . But can a government agency, charged with\\n  re pon ibilitie  of breaking the cipher  of other nation ,\\n  countenance the publication of a cipher that it cannot break? Can\\n  a re earcher in good con cience publi h  uch a cipher that might\\n  undermine the effectivene  of hi  own government  code-breaker ?\\n  One might argue that publication of a provably- ecure cipher would\\n  force all government  to behave like Stim on  `gentlemen, but one\\n  mu t be aware that open re earch in cryptography i  fraught with\\n  political and ethical con ideration  of a  everity than in mo t\\n   cientific field . The wonder i  not that  ome conflict  have\\n  occurred between government agencie  and open re earcher  in\\n  cryptology, but rather that the e conflict  (at lea t tho e of which\\n  we are aware) have been  o few and  o mild.\\n\\n* What are the US export regulation ?\\n\\n  In a nut hell, there are two government agencie  which control\\n  export of encryption  oftware. One i  the Bureau of Export\\n  Admini tration (BXA) in the Department of Commerce, authorized by\\n  the Export Admini tration Regulation  (EAR). Another i  the Office\\n  of Defen e Trade Control  (DTC) in the State Department, authorized\\n  by the International Traffic in Arm  Regulation  (ITAR). A  a rule\\n  of thumb, BXA (which work  with COCOM) ha  le   tringent\\n  requirement , but DTC (which take  order  from NSA) want  to  ee\\n  everything fir t and can refu e to tran fer juri diction to BXA.\\n\\n  The new group mi c.legal.computing carrie  many intere ting\\n  di cu ion  on the law   urrounding cryptographic export, what\\n  people think about tho e law , and many other complex i ue  which\\n  go beyond the  cope of technical group  like  ci.crypt. Make  ure to\\n  con ult your lawyer before doing anything which will get you thrown in\\n  jail; if you are lucky, your lawyer might know a lawyer who ha  at\\n  lea t heard of the ITAR.\\n\\n* What i  TEMPEST?\\n\\n  TEMPEST i  a  tandard for electromagnetic  hielding for computer\\n  equipment. It wa  created in re pon e to the di covery that\\n  information can be read from computer radiation (e.g., from a CRT) at\\n  quite a di tance and with little effort.\\n\\n  Needle  to  ay, encryption doe nt do much good if the cleartext\\n  i  available thi  way.\\n\\n* What are the Beale Cipher , and are they a hoax?\\n\\n  (Thank  to Jim Gillogly for thi  information and John King for\\n  correction .)\\n\\n  The  tory in a pamphlet by J. B. Ward (1885) goe : Thoma \\n  Jeffer on Beale and a party of adventurer  accumulated a huge ma \\n  of trea ure and buried it in Bedford County, Virginia, leaving\\n  three cipher  with an innkeeper; the cipher  de cribe the\\n  location, content , and intended beneficiarie  of the trea ure.\\n  Ward give  a decryption of the  econd cipher (content ) called B2;\\n  it wa  encrypted a  a book cipher u ing the initial letter  of the\\n  Declaration of Independence (DOI) a  key.

The  cribe Matthew i  perhap \\nthe mo t eager to draw out what he think  are prophetic an wer  in\\nthe career of Je u  of Nazareth.  A  you will  ee, Matthew  main\\n trategy i  to take variou  Old Te tament pa age , often not even\\nabout the promi ed Me iah, and apply them to the circum tance  in\\nthe New Te tament.  We mu t al o bear in mind the que tion of the\\nauthenticity of the account .  Since the go pel  were written at\\nlea t 35 year  after Je u  wa  executed, we do not know how much\\nhappened exactly a   tated.  But, for purpo e  of analy i , we\\nwill take particular claim  at face value.\\n\\nImmanuel:\\n\\n       We begin, of cour e, at the beginning.\\n\\n       (Mt 1.21-22):  \"[Mary] will bear a  on, and you,\\n       Jo eph, will name him Je u  (which mean  Gd i \\n        alvation), for he will  ave hi  people from their\\n        in .\"  All thi  happened to fulfil what the lord had\\n        poken by a prophet:\\n\\n       [I aiah 7.1-16]:  In the day  of Ahaz (c. 750 BCE),\\n       king of Judah, Rezin of Syria and Pekah of I rael made\\n       war on Jeru alem (capitol of Judah), but could not\\n       quite conquer it.  When the hou e of David (i.e. Ahaz\\n       and hi  court in Judah) were told of thi , ...it \\n       heart and the heart of it  people  hook...   And, the\\n       lord Gd  aid to I aiah, \"go to meet with Ahaz...\" \\n       ...And the lord  poke to Ahaz (through prophet I aiah,\\n       naturally)  aying, \"A k a  ign of Gd your lord.  It\\n       can be a  deep a  Sheol or a  high a  heaven.\"  But,\\n       Ahaz  aid, \"I wont a k; I will not put the lord to a\\n       te t.\"  Then (I aiah)  aid, \"Hear then, O hou e of\\n       David.  I  it not enough for you to weary men, that\\n       you mu t weary my god too?  Therefore, the lord\\n       him elf will give you a  ign:  Behold, a young woman\\n       i  with child and will bear a  on, and name him\\n       \"Immanuel,\" which mean , \"Gd i  with u .\"   He will\\n       eat curd  and honey when he know  how to refu e evil\\n       and choo e good.  For, before the child know  how to\\n       refu e evil and choo e good, the land of the two king \\n       you dread will have been de erted...\\n\\nMatthew home  in on ju t the  entence that i  in italic . \\nFurther, he the Hebrew word \"almah,\" (young woman), a \\n pecifically, \"virgin.\"  But, thi  i  not a prophecy about the\\nMe iah.  It i  not a prophecy about an event to happen 750 year \\nlater.  It i  not a prophecy about a virgin (bethulah) mother.  In\\n hort, it not about Je u .  Matthew ha  made u e of a ver e out of\\ncontext, and trie  to make it fit the  pecific ca e of Mary.  It\\n hould be noted that if we want to read the prophecy in a general\\nmanner, a very general one, it can be made to fit Mary.  Mary,\\nvirgin or not, wa  indeed a young woman with child.  Of cour e,\\nthe fit i   hady and ha  problem .  Je u , while thought of by\\nlater Chri tian  to be Gd walking among men, wa  never called by\\nthe name, Immanuel.  If Chri tianity wi hed to claim thi  prophecy\\nfor Je u , it become  at be t a cut-and-pa te prophecy... a  econd\\ncla  prophecy.   Not too convincing.\\n\\nEgypt:\\n\\n       After Je u   birth in Bethlehem, Matthew tell  about a\\nquick (and el ewhere unmentioned) excur ion to Egypt, a  if he\\nwi he  to liken Je u  to Mo e .  Thi  wa  done to e cape an\\nalleged infanticidal rampage of the king, Herod.\\n\\n       [Mt 2.15]  ...and remained there until the death of\\n       Herod.  Thi  wa  to fulfil what the lord had  poken:\\n       \"Out of Egypt I have cal-led my  on.\"\\n\\n\\nWhat the lord really  aid wa  thi .\\n\\n       [Ho ea 11.1]  When I rael wa  a child, I loved him. \\n       And, out of Egypt I called my  on.  The more I called\\n       them (my people), the more they went from me; they\\n       kept  acrificing to the Baal , and kept burning\\n       incen e to idol .\\n\\nMatthew conveniently omit  the re t of Ho ea  oracle.  But, it\\nwa  indeed I rael that, once called out of Egypt, wanted to\\nreturn.  Thi  i  hi tory.  Je u  i  certainly not being  poken of\\nhere.  And, if we are to draw  ome kind of parallel here, we wind\\nup with a Je u  that flee  and re i t  Gd.   Again, thi  prophecy\\ni  ju t not a  convincing a  Matthew probably had hoped.\\n\\nRachel Weep :\\n\\n        While Je u  i  off vacationing in Egypt, Matthew  ay  that\\nKing Herod  ought to kill him, and thu  ordered the execution  of\\nall young male children.  Matthew then write ,\\n\\n       [Mt 2.17-18]   By thi , that which wa   poken by the\\n       prophet Jeremiah wa  fulfilled:\\n\\n       \"A voice wa  heard in Ramah, wailing and loud\\n       lamentation-- Rachel weeping for her children;\\n        he refu ed to be con oled, becau e they were\\n       no more.\"   \\n\\nThe reference i  to a pa age in Jeremiah 31.15, referring to the\\ncarrying off of I rael into exile by Sargon (of A yria) in 722\\nBCE.  Rachel, the ance tor of the major tribe  of I rael, Ephraim,\\nand Mana eh, i   aid to weep for her de cendant  who are \"no\\nmore.\"  It i  metaphorical, of cour e,  ince Rachel lived and die \\nbefore the Hebrew  were even in the Egyptian exile.\\n       It i  intere ting to note that it wa  Leah, not Rachel, who\\nwa  the ance tor of the Judean  (the land where Je u  and\\nBethlehem were).  If anyone  hould do weeping for her \"children,\"\\nit i  Leah.  The only connexion that Rachel ha  with Bethlehem i \\nthat the legend  have it that  he wa  buried north of the city,\\n\"on the way to Ephrath, (Bethlehem).\"\\n       A  for Herod and hi  infanticide, it i  rather unlikely\\nthat  uch an event actually occurred.  One never know , but the\\nevent i  not mentioned or alluded to anywhere el e in the Bible,\\nnor i  it mentioned in any of the  ecular record  of the time. \\nHerod wa  particularly unliked in hi  reign, and many far le \\nevil deed  of Herod were carefully recorded.  Thi  might be a\\nprime example of how event  were added to Je u   life to enhance\\nthe me age of the church  go pel.\\n       Becau e of the whole  tory   imilarity to the tale of the\\ninfant Mo e  in Egypt, it i  highly likely that it i  a device  et\\nup by Matthew to add prophetic, yet artificial, approval of Je u .\\nIt i  not  urpri ing that Matthew conveniently neglect  to mention\\nthe re t of the Jeremiah quote.   The \"children\" the prophet\\n peak  of are not dead, but exiled in the A yrian Empire.  Gd\\ncomfort  the weeping Rachel,  aying that the children will be\\nreturned-- he will gather them back together.  Of cour e, thi \\nwould not  uit Matthew  purpo e, a  the children he  peak  of are\\ndead for good.  Again, the \"prophecy\" Matthew  et  up i  not even\\nthat, and to anyone who bother  to check it out, i  not too\\nconvincing.\\n\\nThe Nazarene:\\n\\n       We do not even have to go to the next chapter to find\\nanother Matthean prophecy.  After leaving Egypt, Jo eph & wife\\ntake the infant Je u  to live in the city of Nazareth, \\n\\n       [Mt 2.23]  ...that what wa   poken of by the prophet \\n       might be fulfilled, \"He  hall be called a Nazarene.\"\\n\\nFir t thing we notice i  that Matthew doe  not mention the name of\\nthe prophet( ) thi  time.  Second, we have to a k who \"He\" i . \\nThere are no Me ianic prophecie   peaking of a Nazarene.  Wor e,\\nthere are no prophecie , period, mentioning a Nazarene.  Still\\nwor e, there are no Nazarene  mentioned in the Old Te tament at\\nall.  In the book of Judge , an angel tell  Sam on  mother that\\n he will,\\n\\n       [Judge  13.5]  \"...conceive and bear a  on.  No razor\\n        hall tough hi  head, for he will be a Nazirite to hi \\n       god from the day of hi  birth.  He will deliver I rael\\n       from the hand  of the Phili tine .\"\\n\\nThi  i  of cour e not a prophecy of Je u , or the me iah of Gd. \\nBut, it i  the be t that can be found.  Obviou ly, Matthew ha \\nbegun to go overboard in cut-and-pa te prophecie , in that he i \\n imple making them up now.\\n\\nBearing our\\nDi ea e :\\n\\n       Je u  next goe  around healing people of phy ical illne e \\nand di abilitie .\\n\\n       [Mt 8.17]   Thi  wa  to fulfil what wa   poken by the\\n       prophet I aiah, \"He took our infirmitie  and bore our\\n       di ea e .\"\\n\\nA  expected, the ver e quoted in I aiah i  quoted out of context,\\nand a few word  are  kewed to fit the Chri tian  cheme.  We have,\\n\\n       [I  53.4]  Surely he, [the  uffering  ervant], ha \\n       borne our  ickne , and carried our pain .\\n\\nFrom a reading of the  urrounding pa age  in I aiah, we know that\\nthe prophet i   peaking in pre ent ten e of the collective nation\\nof I rael, Jehovah  cho en  ervant and people.  He  peak  to the\\nI raelite   uffering in exile, in the voice of the gentile nation \\nthat look upon it.  Thi  image i  deeply ingrained in Jewi h\\nidentity --an image of a cha ti ed, yet cheri hed, I rael a  the\\nin trument of the nation   alvation by Gd.\\n      The ver e   peak of I rael taking on the  ickne e  which\\nare the literal and metaphorical manife tation  of guilt and\\ndi cipline.  They do not  peak of a \" ervant\" going around and\\nhealing people.  Notice that the  ervant in I aiah take  on the\\n ickne e  and pain  of the nation  (and individual Jew ).  Je u ,\\na  we all know, did not take the di ea e  onto him elf.  The\\nver e  here in I aiah are not a prophecy of  omething to come, but\\nrather  omething that had already happened.  While it i  believed\\nthat Je u  took on the eternal puni hment of hell, he did not bear\\nthe illne e  he healed.  So, while  omeone might want to  ay\\nthat, figuratively, Je u  reenacted the deed  of I rael in hi \\n piritual atonement, he ha  to admit that Matthew  parallel\\nmi e  where he intended it to have it  effect.\\n\\n\\nSilent Me iah:\\n\\n      Upon healing multitude  of commoner , it i   aid that Je u \\nordered them to keep quiet, pre umable  o that he wouldnt arou e\\nthe attention of the local ruler .\\n\\n       [Mt 12.15-21]  Thi  wa  to fulfill what wa   poken by\\n       the prophet I aiah.   \\n\\n       \"Behold my  ervant whom I have cho en, my beloved,\\n       with whom my  oul i  plea ed.  I will put my  pirit on\\n       him, and he will announce ju tice to the Gentile .  He\\n       will not wrangle or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear\\n       hi  voice in the  treet .  He will not break a brui ed\\n       reed or quench a  moldering wick until he bring \\n       ju tice to victory, and the gentile  will hope in hi \\n       name.\"\\n\\nThe I aiah pa age quoted read ,\\n\\n       [I  42.1-4]  Behold my  ervant whom I uphold, my\\n       cho en, in whom my  oul delight .  I have put my\\n        pirit on him, and he will bring forth ju tice to the\\n       nation .  We will not cry or lift up hi  voice, or\\n       make it heard in the  treet.  He will not break a\\n       brui ed reed, or quench a  moldering wick.  He will\\n       faithfully bring forth ju tice.  He will not fail\\n       (burn dimly) or be di couraged (brui ed) until he ha \\n       e tabli hed ju tice in the earth.  And the coa tland \\n       await hi  law.\\n\\nYou  ee, Matthew ha  conveniently left out part of the pa age,\\nbecau e it doe  not  uit the dealing  of Je u .  Chri tian  could\\nnever think of Je u  failing, never would the \"light\" of mankind\\nburn dimly.  But, the  ervant nation of I rael will indeed come to\\nan end when it  job i  done.  When the gentile  come to embrace\\nGd there will no longer be a cho en people, but rather all will\\nbe the children of Gd.  Al o, the ending phra e ha  been changed\\nfrom the Judaic \"...the coa tland  await hi  law.\" to the\\nChri tologic, \"the Gentile  will hope in hi  name.\"   While the\\noriginal proclaim  the Torah law of Jehovah, the other rewrite  it\\nto fit it   trange doctrine of \"believing in the name.\"  If one\\nha  any doubt the  ervant referred to i  not Je u , one ha  only\\nto read the whole chapter, I aiah 42, and hear about the beloved\\nbut blind and imperfect  ervant, \"a people robbed and\\nplundered...\"   So, we  ee that when Matthew  attempt at\\n\"prophecy\" i  examined, it crumble .\\n\\nThree Day  and\\nThree Night :\\n\\n      Now we come upon a prophecy  uppo edly uttered by the very\\nmouth of the god Je u  him elf.  He  peak  of hi  crucifixion and\\nre urrection.\\n\\n       [Mt 12.40]   For a  Jonah wa  in the belly of the\\n       whale for three day  and three night ,  o will the Son\\n       of Man be in the heart of the earth three day  and\\n       three night .\\n\\nBefore any further di cu ion can occur, it i  nece ary to know\\nhow the Jew  under tood day .  A  far a  day name  went, each wa \\n24 hour  long, la ting from  un et 6pm to the following  un et\\n6pm.  What wa  referred to a  a \"day\" wa  the period of light from\\n6am to the ending  un et at 6pm.  Thu , according to our time\\n cale, a  abbath day began at 6pm Friday evening, and la ted until\\n6pm  aturday evening.  Thi  i  why the Jew  celebrate their\\n abbath on the daylight portion of Saturday , in tead of Sunday . \\n(It  eem  like a real miracle that Chri tian  didnt forget that\\nSaturday wa  indeed the  eventh and la t day of the week!)  Thu ,\\nwhen day  and night  are referred to together, 12 hour daylight\\nportion  and 12 hour night period  are being  poken of.  Thu ,\\nJe u   ay  that he will be in the grave, or in hell, or otherwi e\\nunre urrected for three day  and three night .\\n\\n      A  the good book tell  u , Je u  wa  crucified on the \"ninth\\nhour,\" which i  3pm, Friday afternoon.  He then wa  put into the\\ngrave  ometime after that.  Then, Je u  left the grave, \"ro e,\"\\nbefore dawn of what we call Sunday (The dawn after the  abbath wa \\nover).  What thi  mean  i  that Je u  wa , u ing our time for\\nclarity, in the grave from 6pm Friday night to  ome time before\\n6am Sunday morning.  We could al o add a little time before 6pm\\nFriday,  ince the bible i  not  pecific here.  What thi  mean \\nu ing Jewi h time i  that he wa  in the grave for one day, two\\nnight , and po ibly a couple of hour  of one day.  Certainly thi \\ni  a problem for Je u  prediction.  There i  ab olutely no way we\\nare even able to have hi  death involve three day  and three\\nnight  --even u ing modern time mea urement .   We then are led to\\n u pect that thi  error i  another one of Matthew  little\\nmi take , and that the go pel writer put fal e word  into hi \\ngod  mouth.   And no matter who made the prediction, it i  more\\nthan unconvincing... it i  counter-convincing.\\n\\nHearing &\\nUnder tanding:\\n\\n     Je u  tool on a habit of  peaking to hi  va t audience  in\\nparable --  torie  in which a deeper meaning could be found, if\\nyou were already one of the elect, tho e cho en to under tand the\\nme age of Je u .  He rea on  that tho e who can under tand the\\nparable  are the one  he want .  If the people cannot under tand\\nthem, there i  no need to bother with them,  ince they will not\\naccept the \"plain\" me age any better.  Matthew  ay ,\\n\\n       [Mt 13.14-16]  With them [the audience] indeed in\\n       fulfilled the prophecy of I aiah which  ay , \\n\\n       \"You will indeed hear but never under tand; and you\\n       will indeed  ee, but never perceive.  Becau e thi \\n       people  heart ha  grown dull, their ear  are heavy of\\n       hearing, and they have  hut their eye   o the they\\n       would not perceive with them, her with their ear , and\\n       under tand with their heart, and turn for me to heal\\n       them.\"\\n\\nThe original I aiah pa age  are part of hi  earlier work , hi \\ncall to the mini try.  Thi  i  in 740 BCE, when I rael i \\nflouri hing, right before it fall  under the authority of A yria. \\nI aiah  ee  the good time  ending, and al o a vi ion from Gd,\\ncalling him to bring reform to I rael and Judah.\\n\\n       [I  6.9-13]  And Gd  aid, \"Go, and  ay to thi \\n       people, `Hear and hear, but do not under tand;  ee and\\n        ee, but do not perceive.   Make the heart of thi \\n       people fat, make their ear  heavy, and  hut their\\n       eye ,  o they will not  ee with their eye , or hear\\n       with their ear , and under tand with their heart , and\\n       turn and be healed.\"  Then I aiah  aid, \"How long,\\n       lord?\"  And he  aid, \"Until the citie  lie wa te\\n       without inhabitant, and hou e  without men, and the\\n       land i  utterly de olate, and the Gd  take men far\\n       away, and for aken place  are many in the land.  And\\n       though a tenth will remain in it, it will be burned\\n       again, like a terebinth or an oak who e  tump  till\\n        tand  when the tree i  felled.\" The holy  eed i  it \\n        tump.\\n\\nHere we  ee that it i  really Gd who cau e  the people of I rael\\nto  top li tening to the prophet  warning , but reaffirm  the\\npromi e made to Solomon  (and David )  eed/lineage.  If you read\\nthe re t of I aiah, you find that thi  i  done to fulfil the plan\\nof Gd to u e I rael a  a  ervant, a light to the nation .  (Look\\nat I aiah 42.18-25, 48.20, 49.3)\\n     We  ee that Matthew ha  cut-and-pa ted ju t a little portion\\nof I aiah  ver e, to  uit hi  own go pel need .  More than that,\\nhe ha  altered the word , to make it fit the people who didnt\\nunder tand Je u    torie .  And, a  we  ee, I aiah  ver e  are\\nnot prophecie , but rather command  from Gd to him, in the\\npre ent.   Once again, Matthew  prophecy fall  flat on it  face. \\n\\n     Matthew trie  again to make Je u   parable  look like they\\nhave the prophetic approval.\\n\\n       [Mt 13.35]  ...he  aid nothing to them without a\\n       parable.  Thi  wa  to fulfil what wa   poken of by the\\n       prophet, \"I will open my mouth to them in parable .

You might al o want to know that earlier copie \\nof Matthew  go pel even in erted I aiah  name a  thi  prophet. \\nApparently, later  cribe  caught the error and tried to cover  ome\\nof it up.\\n     Perhap  the mo t  ignificant part of thi  i  that, once\\nagain, Matthew ha  altered the Old Te tament Scripture .  A  Je u \\nha   aid earlier, he  peak  in parable   o that  ome will not\\nunder tand them.  The parable  in the P alm  are not to be hidden. \\nFurther, they  peak of thing  \"known, that our father  have told\\nu .\"  Je u  deal  with thing  \"hidden  ince the foundation of the\\nworld.\"  Indeed Je u  dealt in a lot of  ecrecy and confu ion. \\nThi  i  in direct oppo ition to the parable  in the P alm .  No\\nwonder Matthew had to rewrite them!   And  till once again,\\nMatthew  artificial prophecie  fall flat on their face.  But,\\nChri tian  rarely look at thi .

Not knowing what\\nepilep y wa , the people thought tho e with the di ea e were\\npo e ed with demon .  It i  no wonder that the di ciple  were\\nunable to \"di po e \" the epileptic.  But, Je u , perhap  no more\\nenlightened than they, i  reported to have rebuked them,  aying\\nthey didnt have enough faith.   Thi   eem   trange.  Why wa  thi \\ndemon  pecial?  It  eem  that either a true believer ha  faith or\\nhe doe  not.  Apparently, enough faith will allow  omeone to move\\nmountain .  Of cour e, you will find no one, the e day  that can\\nmove real mountain .  No one part   ea .

You, dear\\nreader, have not  een Gd.  Not literally, you know that to be\\ntrue. (I know that  pre umptuou  and bold.  But,  earching your\\nheart, you know what I mean.)  All that weve  een religion  do i \\nmake people feel good and content about not  eeing Gd.  They  ay\\nour little faith doe  not merit u  to  ee Gd.

Thu , he ha  Je u  call for\\nboth a colt and an adult a .  From Matthew  ver ion, we get a\\ncomical picture of the divine Chri t  weating it to  traddle two\\ndonkey .  Thi  could inevitably lead to a theological,\\nproctological dilemma!   We find that in the account written\\nearlier by St. Mark, only the colt wa  called for and brought to\\nJe u .  Thi  indeed fit  the ver e  of Zechariah properly, and\\n how  u  that in Matthew attempt to u e prophetic ver e , he ha \\nbungled.  Now, excluding many re pectable Chri tian  I have met, I\\nhave noticed that while Chri t i  thought to have ridden on a e ,\\nthe  ituation i  often rever ed nowaday ...\\n\\n       Then, entering the Jeru alem temple, the prie t  were\\nangered at people and young ter  calling Je u  the me iah.  But,\\nJe u  replied a  we might expect Matthew to have done,\\n\\n       [Mt 21.16]  Havent you read?  `Out of the mouth of\\n       babe  and  uckling  thou ha  brought perfect prai e.\\n\\nIt i  more likely that Matthew made thi  re pon e up  ince Je u \\nwa  never one to point out  uch little \"prophetic\" thing  AND\\n ince, a  we might expect, the quote i  in error, which  eem  to\\nfit Matthew  track record quite well.  We might a k Je u  or\\nMatthew, \"Havent you read?\" for the  ource read ,\\n\\n       [P alm  8.1-2]  O YaHWeH our lord, how maje tic i \\n       your name in the whole world!

There i  no \"perfect prai e\"\\n poken of in the p alm, and what prai e i  there i  given to Gd,\\nnot hi  me iah king, and not Je u .  A  mentioned, it  eem  to be\\nju t one more ca e of Matthew  pen making up convenient prophetic\\n cripture.\\n\\nYHVH  aid to \\nmy lord...:\\n\\n      Je u  i   aid to have a ked from whom the promi ed Jewi h\\nme iah-king i  to be de cended.  The Jew  agree-- it i  king\\nDavid.  But, then Je u  counter  by quoting P alm  110,\\n\\n       \"The LORD  aid to my Lord,  it at my right hand, until\\n       I put your enemie  under your feet.\"\\n\\nTaken at face value, Je u  i  denying the nece ity of Davidic\\nde cent.  One a ume  he i  in oppo ition to their an wer.  Of\\ncour e, the Chri tian an wer i  that he agree , but i  trying to\\nmake  ome hidden point, to reveal  ome my tery about the divine\\nnature of the me iah-king.  It  tempting to believe thi , if one\\ni  a Chri tian and not intere ted in matter  of inve tigation. \\nBut, there are problem .\\n       In Je u   time, the p alm wa  thought to be about the\\nme iah.  And, it i  ea y to  ee why David might refer to the\\nme iah a  hi   uperior.  We need only look at the  cripture \\nabout the me iah to  ee that he i  expected to be a great king,\\nbringing the Jew  to time  even better than tho e under David \\nrule.  Of cour e, the Jew  li tening had no good an wer, and the\\npa age could indeed refer to a divine me iah,  uch a  the\\nChri tian  wor hip.  The problem lie  in the meaning of thi \\np alm, an error that apparently  everal Jew  of Je u   time had\\nal o made.  One mu t remember that there were variou  faction \\namong the Jew , often a  a re ult of different expectation  of the\\nme iah-king.  Je u  wa  apparently one of the e adventi t , like\\nhi  audience, who thought the me iah  advent wa  imminent, and\\nwho interpreted P alm  110, among other , a  being me ianic.\\nWhat i  the problem, then?  P alm 110 literally read ,\\n\\n       YHVH  utterance to my lord:\\n\\t\"Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemie  your\\n       foot tool.\"\\n\\n       YHVH  end  forth your mighty  cepter from Zion.  Rule\\n       in the mid t of your foe !  Your people will offer\\n       them elve  freely on the day you lead your ho t on the\\n       holy mountain .  \\n\\n       \"You are a prie t of the order of Melchizedek\\n       forever.\"\\n\\nThe word \"lord\" i  often mi takenly capitali ed by Chri tian\\nbible  to denote divinity in thi  lord.  But, in the Hebrew, the\\nword i  \"adoni,\" and no capitali ation exi t .  Adoni  imply mean \\n\"lord,\" a generic term a  we would u e it.  It i  u ed often in\\nthe  cripture  to refer to king  and to Gd.  It i  merely an\\naddre  of re pect.  \\n      There i  nothing in the text it elf to imply that the word\\nrefer  either to divinity or to the me iah-king.  That thi  i \\n uppo ed to be written by David i  not certain.  The title of the\\np alm tran late  to either \"a p alm of David,\" or \"a p alm about\\nDavid.\"  It  eem  fitting to a ume it to be written by a court\\npoet, about David  covenant and endor ement from Gd.  If the\\np alm had been written by David, it i  unlikely that he would be\\ntalking about the me iah.  The idea of a perfect king, de cended\\nfrom David, wa  not pre ent in David  age.  We have exten ive\\ntale  of David  doing  and  aying -- none of which include any\\nprai e  of a me iah.\\n     Many of the p alm   how evidence of being written long after\\nDavid wa  dead, in time  of the exile when Gd had put hi   how of\\nfavour for David  kingdom on hold.  \\n     The de cription in the p alm fit David very well.  David wa \\npromi ed by Gd a ri e to power, victory over hi  enemie ,\\n ucce ful judgement among the nation  he conquered.  He achieved\\nthe prie thood common to Melchizedek in being a righteou  king,\\nenabled to ble  the people.   It all fit .\\n      We do not have to blame thi  problem on Matthew alone,\\nthough.  Here, there i  not artificial prophecy alluded to, though\\nhi  u e of the  cripture i  rather que tionable.  Still, thi \\nevent i  common to the other go pel  too.  So, we let Matthew off\\na little more ea ily thi  time.  It i  intere ting to note,\\nthough, how Matthew dre e  up the event.  The earlier go pel of\\nMark tell  the tale with Je u   imply  peaking to a crowd. \\nMatthew ha  the Phari ee , who became the religiou  competition of\\nan infant Chri tianity, be the target of Je u   que tion.  A  we\\nmight expect, Matthew write  that the event end  up by\\nembarra ing the Phari ee .  Such power i  the pen.\\n\\nMo e  & Je u ,\\nHad it Together\\nAll Along...:\\n\\n       We leave the go pel  tory of Matthew momentarily to  ee a\\np eudo-prophecy in John  go pel.  The go pel  tory of John\\nde erve   pecial treatment, becau e it  eem  to be  o far removed\\nfrom the real event  of Je u   career a  told by even Matthew. \\nBut, for the moment, we will ju t look at one ver e.  The early\\nchurch leader  founded a religion on the Jewi h hope  of a me iah\\nking, and on an artificial exten ion of the original promi e  made\\nby Gd.  When con tructing the hi tory of Abraham, Mo e  wrote of\\na promi e of land and nationhood to the Jewi h people.  While thi \\nwa  accompli hed eventually, under the rule of king David, the\\nChri tian  who came along later decided that they would claim the\\nfulfillment of the promi e.  But, to do  o, they expanded on the\\npromi e, preaching about a heavenly kingdom.\\n\\n       [John 8.56] (J.C.  peaking) Your father, Abraham,\\n       rejoiced to  ee My day.  He  ay it and wa  glad.\\n\\nIt would be nice to tie in approval for Je u  from Abraham, but,\\nAbraham knew nothing of Je u  or a me iah, or anything Chri tian. \\nI have tried, and failed to find any event in the Old Te tament\\nwhich corre pond  to John  little prophecy.  It i  par for the\\ncour e to  ee St. John making up Old Te tament backing , ju t like\\nhi  forerunner Matthew.  Many Chri tian  know that their faith ha \\nmany of it  foundation  in  uch fraud, and it i   urpri ing they\\n till cling to it.\\n\\nThe Potter \\nField:\\n\\n      We are told that Je u  wa  betrayed while in Jeru alem by\\none of hi  follower , Juda  I cariot.   Matthew write ,\\n\\n       [Mt 27.5-10]  And throwing down the piece  of  ilver\\n       in the temple, [Juda ] departed... But, the chief\\n       prie t , taking the  ilver,  aid, \"It i nt lawful for\\n       u  to put it in the trea ury,  ince it i  blood\\n       money.\"  So they... bought a potter  field with it to\\n       bury  tranger  in... Then wa  fulfilled what wa \\n        poken by the prophet Jeremiah,\\n\\n       \"And they took the thirty piece  of  ilver, the price\\n       of him on whom a price had been  et by  ome of the\\n        on  of I rael, and they gave them for the potter \\n       field, a  the lord directed me.\"\\n\\nThi  prophecy i  an utterly gro  ba tardi ation of Old Te tament\\nScripture.  Fir t, Matthew ha  made a mi take regarding the name\\nof the prophet.  It i  Zechariah who utter  the ver e  which\\nMatthew make  u e of.\\n\\n       [Zech. 11.12-13]  ...And they weighed out my wage ,\\n       thirty  hekel  of  ilver.  Then YHVH  aid to me, \"Ca t\\n       them to the trea ury,\" --the lordly price at which I\\n       wa  paid off by them.  So I took the thirty  hekel  of\\n        ilver and ca t them into the trea ury in the hou e of\\n       YHVH.\\n\\nFir t of all, the ver e  of Zechariah do not deal with a betrayer\\nof the me iah, or of Gd.  The deal with a  hepherd, mo t likely\\na prie t, cho en to  erve a function of pre iding over the people\\n hortly before Gd would  end Judah and I rael into conflict with\\none another.  The word, \"trea ury,\" had been replaced by the King\\nJame  Scholar  with \"to the potter,\" preci ely becau e thi  made\\nMatthew  quote fit better.  But, thi  i  a blatant error.  The\\ncorrect tran lation of the Hebrew i  indeed \"trea ury,\" which al o\\nmake  perfect  en e in Zechariah  context, wherea  \"potter \\nfield\" i  totally unrelated.  Whether the mi tran lation wa \\nintentional or not  eem  to be beyond  peculation.  However, given\\nMatthew  track record, one find  it hard to re i t the notion of\\nintentional di hone ty.\\n      Of cour e, Matthew would have ample rea on for altering the\\ntext.  The thirty piece  of  ilver match Juda    ituation, and if\\na  mo t Chri tian   eem to be, the reader i  willing to di regard\\nthe contextual incongruity, Matthew might have another prophecy to\\nto  around.  However, the correct tran lation of Zechariah\\ndirectly contradict  the  ituation with Juda  and the high\\nprie t .  The high prie t  would not put the money in the\\ntrea ury.  The worthle   hepherd of Zechariah doe  exactly the\\noppo ite!  Of cour e, to the average Thur day-Night Bible  tudent,\\nthe \"prophecy\" a  pre ented by Matthew would be taken at New\\nTe tament face value.  To tho e, Matthew  work i  convincing\\nenough.\\n\\nWine, Vinegar,\\n& Ca ting Lot :\\n\\n      Then, Je u  i  led away to be crucified.\\n\\n       [Mt 27.34-35]  ...they gave him vinegar to drink,\\n       mingled with gall; but when he ta ted it, he would not\\n       drink it.  And, when they had crucified him, they\\n       divided hi  garment  among them by ca ting lot : that\\n       it might be fulfilled what wa   poken by the prophet,\\n\\n       \"They parted my garment  among them, and upon my\\n       ve ture did they ca t lot .\"\\n\\nFir t of all, the vinegar offered to Je u  i  actually common  our\\nwine, of the type that Roman  oldier  drank regularly.  We find\\nthat right before Je u  die , the  oldier  them elve  give him\\n ome to drink --not polluted with gall.\\n\\n       [Jn 19.28-30]  Je u ...  aid, \"I thir t.\"  A bowl of\\n       vinegar  tood there,  o they put a  ponge full of the\\n       vinegar on hy op and held it to hi  mouth.  When he\\n       had received the vinegar, he  aid, \"It i  fini hed;\"\\n\\nBut, Matthew  eem  to be drawing on, not a pa age from the\\nprophet , but one from the P alm .\\n\\n       [P  69.20-28]  I looked for pity, but there wa  none;\\n       and for comforter , but I found none.  They gave me\\n       poi on for food (lit. they put gall in my meat), and\\n       for my thir t, they gave me vinegar to drink...  Add\\n       to them puni hment upon puni hment, may they have no\\n       acquittal from thee.  Let them be blotted out of the\\n       Book of the Living.\\n\\nOf cour e, the  our wine offered to Je u  i  done at hi  reque t\\nof drink.  Thi  doe  indeed  eem to be a  how of pity.  The p alm\\nquoted i  about David and hi  political and military enemie .  It\\ni  not about the me iah or Je u .  It i  then not  urpri ing that\\nwe run into further problem when we  ee that the \"Je u \" in the\\np alm a k  Gd for the damnation of the \"crucifier ,\" wherea  the\\nJe u  of the go pel   ay ,\\n\\n       [Lk 23.34]  Je u   aid, \"Father, forgive them, the\\n       dont know what they do!\"\\n\\nFurther, Matthew mi e  with hi  attempt to create prophecy by\\nhaving gall (a bitter  ub tance) put into Je u   drink, not hi \\nmeat, a  the p alm  tipulate .\\n\\n       With the \"prophecy\" of the vinegar faulty, we naturally\\na k, \"What of the ca ting of lot ?\"  Thi  bring  up the 22nd\\nP alm, which de erve  di cu ion all by it elf.  Suffice it now to\\n ay that the fact that Je u   clothe  were divided a  told i  no\\ngreat thing.  It turn  out that thi  happened often to any felon\\nin tho e day .  A  we will  oon  ee, it i  perhap  the lea t\\nerroneou  pa age of the p alm when applied to Je u .  It doe \\nindeed bring up the intere ting que tion a  to the quality of\\nJe u   clothe .  For a man  o removed from worldly po e ion ,\\nhi  owner hip of clothe  worthy of ca ting lot  rai e   ome\\n u picion .\\n\\nThe 22nd P alm:\\n\\n      Thi  p alm i  attributed to David, a  a lament of hi \\ncondition under the attack of hi  enemie .  It become  a  ong of\\nprai e to YHVH and of hope.  Taken out of context, part  of it\\n eem to fit the plight of Je u  at the crucifixion quite well.  We\\nwill examine the primary pa age .\\n\\n       Ver e 1-2:  My god, my god! why have you for aken me?! \\n       Why are you  o far from helping me, far from the word \\n       of my groaning?  Oh, my god, I cry by day, but you\\n       dont an wer, and by night, but find no re t.\\n\\nJe u  i   aid to have cried the fir t  entence while on the cro . \\nThi   ugge t  that the whole p alm i  really about Je u , rather\\nthan king David.  Of cour e, the re t of the fir t  tanza doe  not\\nfit a  nicely to Je u  or hi  execution.  Je u  i  not pictured a \\ncomplaining about the whole ordeal, he i   uppo ed to be like \"the\\nlamb led mute before it   hearer .\"  Indeed, Je u  doe nt do much\\ngroaning, even when on the cro .  He certainly doe  not cry by\\nboth day and night on the cro .\\n\\n       6-8:  But, I am a worm, and no man--  corned by men... \\n       All who  ee me mock at me.  They make face  and wag\\n       their head ;  \"He committed hi  cau e to YHVH.  So let\\n       him deliver him... for he delight  in him.\"\\n\\nThi   eem  to fit Je u   execution pretty well, with the\\nexception of the Holy me iah being called a worm.\\n\\n       12-13:  Many bull  encompa  me... they open their\\n       mouth  widely at me like a ravening and roaring lion.\\n\\n       16-18:  Yea, dog  are round about me, a company of\\n       evildoer  encir-cle me, they have pierced my hand  and\\n       feet.  I can  ee all my bone ... They divide my\\n       garment  among them, and ca t lo t for my raiment.\\n\\n       19-21:  But you, YHVH, be not far away!  ...Deliver my\\n        oul from the  word, my life from the power of the\\n       dog!  Save me from the mouth of the lion, and my\\n       afflicted  oul from the horn  of the wild bull!\\n\\nIt would  eem quite convincing, and Im  ure the early Chri tian\\nfather  who wrote of thi  prophecy thought  o too.  Unfortunately,\\nthi  prophecy ha  a fatal flaw.  The word  \"have pierced\" really\\ndo not exi t in the p alm.  The correct Hebrew tran lation i ,\\n\\n       16:  Yea, dog  are round about me, a company of\\n       evildoer  encircle  me, like the lion, they are at my\\n       hand  and feet...\\n\\nIn Hebrew the phra e \"like the lion\" and a very rare verb form\\nwhich can mean \"pierced\" differ by one phonetic character.  The\\nword in the Hebrew text i  literally, \"like the lion\" (kaari),\\nwhich make   en e in the context, and even further fit  the animal\\nimagery employed by the p alm writer.  It i  convenience that\\nwould urge a Chri tian to change the word to \"kaaru.\"   But, to\\nadd the needed (yet artificial) weight to the \"prophecy\" thi  i \\nju t what the Chri tian tran lator  have cho en to do.  While the\\ncorrect tran lation doe  not eliminate the p alm from referring to\\nJe u , it  ab ence doe  not  ay much for the hone ty of the\\ntran lator .\\n\\n       Apart from the erroneou  ver e 16, the p alm doe  not lend\\nit elf to Je u   o ea ily.  Ver e 20  peak  of the  ufferer being\\n aved from a  word rather than a cro .  Thi  naturally fit  the\\np alm  true  ubject, king David.  A  a  ide note, we now know\\nthat crucifixion  did not pierce the hand , the palm , but rather\\nthe forearm .  Thi  doe nt  ay much in favour of the traditional\\nthought of a re urrected Je u   howing hi  di ciple  the  car  on\\nhi  palm .  But then, fact  arent bound by our religiou  belief .\\n\\n      Matthew e cape  culpability thi  time, a  he doe  not\\nattempt to draw many direct link  between thi  p alm and hi  lord\\nJe u .  But the p alm, like many other , wa  on the mind  of all\\nthe go pel writer  when they compiled the  torie  and\\ninterpretation  of Je u   life and death.  How much the e\\n cripture  may have contributed to what actually got written down\\ni  a que tion that ha   eriou  repercu ion  for Chri tian\\ntheology.  It i  ea y to  ee, for tho e who are not faithful\\nfundamentali t , how  ome of the event  in the New Te tament might\\nhave been \"enhanced\" by  cribe   uch a  the eager Matthew.  But,\\nit doe  le  to  peculate than to  imply inve tigate  criptural\\nmatter  and prophetic claim .  So far, thi  ha  not  aid good\\nthing  for St. Matthew.\\n\\nThe reference to the piercing look  a lot like Je u  \\ncrucifixion.  John  go pel recount, written about 70 year  after\\nthe fact, tell  u  at Je u   execution,\\n\\n       [Jn 19.34,37]  But one of the  oldier  pierced hi \\n        ide with a  pear, and out came blood and water...\\n       the e thing  took place that Scripture be fulfilled...\\n       \"The will look on him whom theyve pierced.\"\\n\\nOf cour e, thi  i  built on a pa age taken blatantly out of\\ncontext.   Prophet Zechariah tell  u  how much of the nation of\\nI rael will  plit off from Jeru alem and Judah and go to war with\\nthem.\\n\\n       [Zc 12.7-10]  And YHVH will give victory to Judah...\\n       And on that day, I will  eek to de troy the nation \\n       that come again t Jeru alem (in Judah).  And I will\\n       pour a  pirit of compa ion and  upplication... on\\n       Jeru alem  o that when they look on him who they have\\n       pierced, they will mourn, and weep bitterly over him\\n       like you weep over a fir tborn child.\\n\\nJohn  attempt to make up prophecy i  perhap  weaker that\\nMatthew  attempt .  Matthew, at lea t, u ually excontext  more\\nthan ju t one pa age.  John  error  are gro ly obviou  and\\nblatant here.  It doe  not  peak well for any of the go pel\\nwriter , a  it help  to  how how the prophetic a pect  of their\\nreligion were founded.\\n\\n\\x0c\\nReckoned with\\nTran gre or :\\n\\n       After hi  arre t, Je u  i  quickly executed for claiming\\nthe Jewi h king hip, me iah hip.   According to one ver ion of\\nthe go pel tale, Je u  get  executed along with two thieve .\\n\\n       [Mk 15.27]  And with him they crucified two robber ,\\n       one on hi  right, one on hi  left.  And  o the\\n        cripture wa  fulfilled which  ay ,\\n\\n       \"He wa  reckoned with the tran gre or .\"\\n\\nHere, Mark i  trying to link Je u  to a pa age in I aiah 53,\\nabout the  ervant nation of I rael.  The pa age i  not about the\\nme iah, for if one read  the whole chapter of I aiah 53, and it \\n urrounding chapter , one  ee  that the  ervant i  a nation.  The\\nver e  are al o about what thi   ervant ha  gone through in the\\npa t, not a prediction of what i  to come, in any event.  The\\n ervant i  thought of a  a criminal.  Thi  al o happen  to fit the\\nde cription of Je u .  Had the pa age really been about the\\nme iah, it  till i  not at all clear why executing Je u  between\\ntwo thieve  would fulfill the \"prophecy\" in I aiah.  Je u  would\\nmore fittingly fulfill it with hi  whole mini try.  He wa \\ncon idered a bla phemer and troublemaker all throughout hi \\ncareer.   Locking onto a  ingle event i  a rather poor way to\\n teal prophecy, at lea t in thi  ca e, a  we  ee that Mark could\\nhave had made a better analogy with general compari on .\\n\\n       Mark goe  on to tell u  how \"tho e who were crucified with\\n[Je u ] al o reviled him.\" [15.32]  Thi  i  to be expected from a\\ncouple of robber .  Of cour e in hi  later recount, St. Luke\\ndecide  to change  ome thing .  Luke tell  u ,\\n\\n       [Lk 23.39-43]  And one of the criminal  who wa  hanged\\n       with him railed, \"Arent you the me iah?! Save\\n       your elf, and u !\"\\n\\nThi  certainly fit  with Mark  recount, which tell  how the\\npeople who crucified Je u   aid, \"Save your elf!\" and that the\\nrobber  did the  ame.  But then Luke goe  on,\\n\\n       But the other [criminal] rebuked [the fir t]  aying,\\n       \"Dont you fear Gd,  ince you are under the  ame\\n        entence of condemnation?  And we, indeed ju tly  o,\\n       for we are receiving the due reward for our deed . \\n       But, thi  man ha  done nothing wrong. And he  aid,\\n       \"Je u , remember me when you come in your kingdom.\" \\n       And Je u  an wered, \"Verily I  ay to you, today you\\n       will be with me in paradi e.\"\\n\\nNow, thi  little dialogue  eem  highly contrived.  It  tretche \\nthe imagination a bit to  ee thi  picture of one ruffian rebuking\\nhi  fellow criminal with  uch eloquent  peech.  We have a rather\\n trange picture of a criminal lamenting over the goodne  of hi \\npuni hment and the ju tne  of hi   uffering.   Such a man,\\napparently noble and of principle, doe nt  eem likely to have\\nbeen a robber.  We wonder at the amount of theatric  created by\\nLuke.  Of cour e, Luke  recount al o di agree  with Mark .  \\nLuke ha  only one criminal revile Je u , not both.  It i  ea y\\nenough to di count the di crepancy becau e the account wa  made\\nup, but tho e who wi h to believe it i  all part of the error free\\nword  of Gd do not have thi  avenue open.  Thi  i  yet another\\nexample of a writer trying to take an Old Te tament pa age and\\nexpand it and reinterpret it to  uit hi  theology.  In thi  ca e,\\nthe embroidery create   ome embarra ing problem , a  we have\\n een.\\n\\nThe End of the\\nWorld--\\n       Mt. 24:\\n\\n       Now come  perhap  one of the mo t extraordinary and\\nembarra ing pa age  in the New Te tament.  It i  found in all\\nthree of the  ynoptic go pel  torie , and ca t   ome of the mo t\\nunfavourable doubt on the whole theory of Chri tianity.  Je u \\nmention  the de truction of the Jewi h temple  and building , and\\nhi  di ciple  a k him about thi , and about the end of the world\\nwhich he ha  been warning about.\\n\\n       The di ciple : Tell u , when will thi  [the temple \\n       de truction] be, and what will be the  ign of your\\n       coming, and of the clo e of the age?\\n\\n       Je u : Take care that no one lead  you a tray, for\\n       many will come in my name,  aying, \"I am the chri t.\"  \\n       ...you will hear of war  and rumour  of war ... for\\n       thi  mu t take place, but the end i  not yet.   For,\\n       nation will ri e again t nation... all thi  i  but the\\n       beginning of the birthpang .\\n             They will deliver you up... put you to death,\\n       and fal e prophet  will ari e and lead many a tray.\\n       ...But he who endure  to the end will be  aved.  Thi \\n       go pel will be preached throughout the whole world, a\\n       te timony to the nation , and then the end will come.\\n             So, when you  ee the de olation  poken of by the\\n       prophet Daniel, ...let tho e who are in Judea flee to\\n       the mountain .\\n\\n             Immediately after the tribulation of tho e day ,\\n       the  un will be darkened... the  tar  will fall from\\n       heaven... then will appear the  ign of the Son of Man\\n       in heaven, and all the tribe  of the earth will mourn,\\n       and  ee the Son of Man coming... and he will  end out\\n       hi  angel ... and gather hi  elect...\\n             Learn the le on of the fig tree: a   oon a  it \\n       branch become  tender and put  forth leave , you know\\n       that  ummer i  near.  So al o, when you  ee all the e\\n       thing , you will know that He i  near, at the very\\n       gate.  Truly I  ay to you, thi  generation will not\\n       pa  away until all the e thing  take place...\\n             But, of the day and hour, no one know ; not the\\n       angel , not the Son, but only the Father... Therefore,\\n       you al o mu t be ready, for the Son of Man i  coming\\n       at an hour you do not expect.\\n\\nFrom thi , it i  clear that Je u  thought the world would in\\nwithin the lifetime  of at lea t  ome of hi  di ciple .  He tell \\nthem that although he doe nt know the exact day or hour, that it\\nwill come, and thu  they mu t be ready.  Theologian  have wet\\ntheir pant  in panic to find  ome way out of thi  Holy Error. \\nBut, unfortunately, Je u  made him elf to explicit.  He told hi \\ndi ciple  that their generation would  till be around at the End,\\nand that they in particular  hould prepare for it, prepare to be\\n wept away.\\n      There have been  ome who re orted to removing the inerrant\\nnature of the Bible, and  aid that the phra e, \"thi  generation\\n hall not pa  away...\" really mean  \"thi  race of people will not\\npa  away...\"  Of cour e, the word for generation i  u ed many\\ntime  to refer to exactly that, the generation of the di ciple . \\nIt i  an intere ting notion that when God decided to learn Greek,\\nhe didnt learn it well enough to make him elf clear.  But. it i \\nquite obviou  from the re t of the dialogue that the di ciple  (at\\nlea t  ome of them) are  uppo ed to live to the End of the World. \\nThe charge of mi tran lation i  completely blown away by looking\\nat the Apo tle  re pon e .  It become  abundantly clear from\\nRev. 22.7, 1 Peter 4.7, 1 John 2.18, and Rev. 22.20, that Je u \\nmeant exactly what he  aid.  The End wa  very near.\\n\\n       For 2,000 year , Chri tian  have rationali ed thi  24th\\nchapter of Matthew, or ignored it  meaning altogether.  For 2,000\\nyear , they have waited for their executed leader to come back,\\nhearing of war , and rumour  of war ,  ure that He i  coming  oon. \\nSurely He mu t be.  All we mu t do i  wait.  Can you imagine how\\ntired He mu t be,  itting around up there, being holy, waiting for\\nju t the right moment to  pring?\\n\\n\\n       So,  hortly after hi  crucifixion, Je u  of Nazareth,\\n(Jo hua-ben-Jo eph), died.   It i   aid that after three day , or\\nthree day  and three night , or three period  of time, or three\\neternal  econd  --or three of whatever they can decide make  for\\nle  trouble-- he wa   een again, re urrected, glowing with divine\\nradiance.  Then the Saviour decided it wa nt in the be t\\nintere t  of hi  new religion to  tick around, and therefore\\ndi appeared from  ight into heaven.  So the  tory goe , anyway. \\nA  ha  been  een, there were many thing  attributed to Je u  when\\npeople got around to writing the go pel  torie  down.  To them,\\nJe u  wa  the fulfiller of all prophecy and  cripture.  We have\\n een, though, that thi  matter i  quite  haky.  But, throughout\\nChurch hi tory, Chri tian  have held fa t to faith, in  imple\\nbelief.  What doctrinal objection  could not be  olved with\\nargumentation or brute force, faith and forgetfulne  kept away\\nfrom que tion.  To que tion and inve tigate ha  never been the\\nea ie t way to treat matter .  Thu  for 2,000 year , the\\nprophecie  cited in the New Te tament have gone on largely\\naccepted.  Thing  may well continue that way for  ome time. \\nPau ing a moment to con ider the way the doctrine  of Chri tianity\\nhave been accepted and u ed (properly or improperly) to  upport\\nwar  and per ecution, I  uppo e there i  one prophecy of which\\nChri tianity can  ecurely keep hold.\\n\\n       [Mt 10.34]  Je u : \"Dont think that I have come to\\n       bring peace on earth.  I havent come to bring peace,\\n       but rather a  word.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

A genocide of Armenian  took place\\nduring peacetime.\\n\\nAnd it wa  a great tragedy for me per onally, becau e I lo t my father in\\ntho e day . He wa   till young. Born in 1926.\\n\\nOn that day, February 28, we were at home. Of cour e we had heard that there \\nwa  unre t in town, my younger brother Alek andr had told u  about it. But we \\ndidnt think . . . we thought that everything would happen outdoor , that they\\nwouldnt go into people  apartment . About five oclock we  aw a large crowd \\nnear the Ko mo  movie theater in our microdi trict. We were  itting at home \\nwatching televi ion. We go out on the balcony and  ee the crowd pour into Mir \\nStreet. Thi  i  right near downtown, next to the airline ticket office, our \\nhou e i  right nearby. That day there wa  a group of policeman with  hield \\nthere. They threw rock  at tho e policemen. Then they moved off in the \\ndirection of our building. They burned a motorcycle in our courtyard and \\n tarted  houting for Armenian  to come out of the building. We  witched off \\nthe light. A  it turn  out, their  ignal wa  ju t the oppo ite: to turn on the\\nlight. That meant that it wa  an Azerbaijani home. We, of cour e, didnt know \\nand thought that if they  aw light  on they would come to our apartment.\\n\\nSuddenly there  pounding on the door. We go to the door, all four of u :\\nthere were four of u  in the apartment. Father, Mother, my younger brother\\nAlek andr, and I. He wa  born in 1959. My father wa  a veteran of World War \\nII and had fought in China and in the Soviet Far Ea t; he wa  a pilot.\\n\\nWe went to the door and they  tarted pounding on it harder, breaking it down \\nwith axe . We  tart to talk to them in Azerbaijani, \"What  going on? What  \\nhappened?\" They  ay, \"Armenian , get out of here!\" We dont open the door, we \\n ay, \"If we have to leave, well leave, well leave tomorrow.\" They  ay, \"No, \\nleave now, get out of here, Armenian dog , get out of here!\" By now theyve \\nbroken the door both on the lock and the hinge  ide . We hold them off a  be t\\nwe can, my father and I on one  ide, and my mother and brother on the other. \\nWe had prepared our elve : we had  everal hammer  and an axe in the apartment,\\nand grabbed what we could find to defend our elve . They broke in the door and\\nwhen the door gave way, we held it for another half-hour. No neighbor , no\\npolice and no one from the city government came to our aid the whole time. We \\nheld the door. They  tarted to  ma h the door on the lock  ide, fir t with an \\naxe, and then with a crowbar.\\n\\nWhen the door gave way--they tore it off it  hinge --Sa ha hit one of them \\nwith the axe. The axe flew out of hi  hand . They al o had axe , crowbar , \\npipe , and  pecial rod  made from armature  haft . One of them hit my father \\nin the head. The pre ure from the mob wa  immen e. When we retreated into the\\nroom, one of them hit my mother, too, in the left part of her face. My brother\\nSa ha and I fought back, of cour e. Sa ha i  quite  trong and hot-tempered, he\\nwa  the judo champion of Sumgait. We had hammer  in our hand , and we injured \\n everal of the bandit --in the head  and in the eye , all that went on. But \\nthey, the injured one , fell back, and other  came to take their place , there\\nwere many of them.\\n\\nThe door fell down at an angle. The mob tried to remove the door,  o a  to go \\ninto the  econd room and to continue . . . to fini h u  off. Father brought \\n kewer  and gave them to Sa ha and me--we flew at them when we  aw Father \\nbleeding: hi  face wa  covered with blood, he had been wounded in the head, \\nand hi  whole face wa  bloody. We ju t threw our elve  on them when we  aw \\nthat. We threw our elve  at the mob and drove back the one  in the hall, drove\\nthem down to the third floor. We came out on the landing, but a group of the \\nbandit  remained in one of the room  they were  ma hing all the furniture in \\nthere, having clo ed the door behind them. We  tarted tearing the door off to \\ncha e away the remaining one  or fini h them. Then a man, an impo ing man of \\nabout 40, an Azerbaijani, came in. When he wa  coming in, Father fell down and\\nMother flew to him, and  tarted to cry out. I jumped out onto the balcony and \\n tarted calling an ambulance, but then the mob  tarted throwing  tone  through\\nthe window  of our veranda and kitchen. We live on the fourth floor. And no \\none came. I went into the room. It  eemed to me that thi  man wa  the leader \\nof the group. He wa  re pectably dre ed in a hat and a trench coat with a \\nfur collar. And he addre ed my mother in Azerbaijani: \"What  with you, \\nwoman, why are you  houting? What happened? Why are you  houting like that?\"\\nShe  ay , \"What do you mean, what happened? You killed  omebody!\" My father \\nwa  a mu ician, he played the clarinet, he played at many wedding , Armenian \\nand Azerbaijani, he played for many year . Everyone knew him. Mother  ay , \\n\"The per on who you killed played at thou and  of Azerbaijani wedding , he \\nbrought  o much joy to people, and you killed that per on.\" He  ay , \"You \\ndont need to  hout,  top  houting.\" And when they heard the voice of thi  \\nman, the 15 to 18 people who were in the other room opened the door and \\n tarted running out. We cha ed after them, but they ran away. That man left, \\ntoo. A  we were later told, down tair  one of them told the other , I dont \\nknow if it wa  from fright or what, told them that we had firearm , even\\nthough we only fought with hammer  and an axe. We raced to Father and  tarted \\nto ma age hi  heart, but it wa  already too late. We a ked the neighbor  to \\ncall an ambulance. The ambulance never came, although we waited for it all \\nevening and all through the night.\\n\\nSomewhere around midnight about 15 policemen came. They informed u  they were \\nfrom Khachma . They  aid, \"We heard that a group wa  here at your place, you \\nhave our condolence .\" They told u  not to touch anything and left. Father lay\\nin the room.\\n\\nSo we  tayed home. Each of u  took a hammer and a knife. We  at at home. Well,\\nwe  ay, if they de cend on u  again well defend our elve . Somewhere around \\none oclock in the morning two people came from the Sumgait Procuracy, \\ninve tigator . They  ay, \"Leave everything ju t how it i , were coming back \\nhere  oon and will bring an expert who will record and photograph everything.\"\\nThen people came from the Republic Procuracy too, but no one helped u  take \\nFather away. The morning came and the neighbor  arrived. We wanted to take \\nFather away  omehow. We called the Procuracy and the police a couple of time ,\\nbut no one came. We called an ambulance, and nobody came. Then one of the \\nneighbor   aid that the bandit  were coming to our place again and we  hould \\nhide. We  ecured the door  omehow or other. We left Father in the room and \\nwent up to the neighbor .\\n\\nThe exce e  began again in the morning. The bandit  came in  everal vehicle ,\\nZIL panel truck , and threw them elve  out of the vehicle  like . . . a \\nlanding force near the center of town. Our building wa  located right there. A\\ncrowd formed. Then they  tarted fighting with the  oldier . Then, in Building \\n19 and 20, that  next to the airline ticket office, they  tarted breaking \\ninto Armenian apartment , de troying property, and  tealing. The Armenian  \\nwerent at home, they had managed to flee and hide  omewhere. And again they \\npoured in the direction of our building. They were  houting that there were \\n ome Armenian  left on the fourth floor, meaning u . \"Theyre up there,  till,\\nup there. Let  go kill them!\" They broke up all the furniture remaining in \\nthe two room , threw it out ide, and burned it in large fire . We were hiding \\none floor up. Something heavy fell. Sa ha threw him elf toward the door \\n houting that it wa  probably Father, they had thrown Father, were defiling \\nthe corp e, probably throwing it in the fire, going to burn it. I heard it, \\nand the  ound wa  kind of hollow, and I  aid, \"No, that  from  ome of the \\nfurniture.\" Mother and I pounced on Sa ha and  topped him  omehow, and calmed \\nhim down.\\n\\nThe mob left  omewhere around eight oclock. They  ma hed open the door and \\nwent into the apartment of the neighbor  acro  from u . They were al o\\nArmenian , they had left for another city.\\n\\nThe father of the neighbor who wa  concealing u  came and  aid, \"Are you \\ncrazy? Why are you hiding Armenian ? Dont you now theyre checking all the \\napartment ? They could kill you and them!\" And to u  :\" . . . Come on, leave \\nthi  apartment!\" We went down to the third floor, to  ome other neighbor . At\\nfir t the man didnt want to let u  in, but then one of hi   on  a ked him and\\nhe relented. We  tayed there until eleven oclock at night. We heard the  ound\\nof motor . The neighbor   aid that it wa  armored per onnel carrier . We went \\ndown tair . There wa  a light on in the room where we left Father. In the \\nother room , a  we found out later, all the chandelier  had been torn down. \\nThey left only one bulb. The bulb wa  burning, which probably wa  a  ignal \\nthey had agreed on becau e there wa  a light burning in every apartment in our\\nMicrodi trict 3 where there had been a pogrom.\\n\\nWith the help of the  oldier  we made it to the City Party Committee and were \\n aved. Our  alvation--my mother , my brother , and mine,--wa  purely \\naccidental, becau e, a  we later found out from the neighbor ,  omeone in the \\ncrowd  houted that we had firearm  up there. Well, we fought, but we were only\\nable to  ave Mother. We couldnt  ave Father. We inflicted many injurie  on \\nthe bandit ,  ome of them  eriou . But other  came to take their place . We \\nwere al o wounded, there wa  blood, and we were  cratched all over--we got our\\n hare. It wa  a miracle we  urvived. We were  aved by a miracle and the \\ntroop . And if troop  hadnt come to Sumgait, the  laughter would have been \\neven greater: probably all the Armenian  would have been victim  of the \\ngenocide.\\n\\nThrough an acquaintance at the City Party Committee I wa  able to contact the \\nleader hip of the military unit that wa  brought into the city, and at their \\norder  we were a igned  pecial people to accompany u , expert . We went to \\npick up Father  corp e. We took it to the morgue. Thi  wa  about two oclock \\nin the morning, it wa  already March 1, it wa  raining very hard and it wa  \\nquite cold, and we were wearing only our  uit . When my brother and I carried \\nFather into the morgue we  aw the burned and di figured corp e . There were \\nabout  ix burned people in there, and the  mall corp e of a burned child. It \\nwa  grue ome. I  uffered a tremendou   hock. There were about ten people \\nthere, but the doctor on duty  aid that becau e of the number  they were being\\ntaken to Baku. There wa  a woman  corp e there too,  he had been . . . well, \\nthere wa  part of a body there . . . a hacked-off part of a woman  body. It \\nwa   omething terrible. The morgue wa  guarded by the landing force . . . The \\nchild that had been killed wa  only ten or twelve year  old. It wa  impo ible\\nto tell if it wa  a boy or a girl becau e the corp e wa  burned. There wa  a \\nman there, too,  everal men. You couldnt tell anything becau e their face  \\nwere di figured, they were in  uch awful condition...\\n\\nNow two and a half month  have pa ed. Every day I recall with horror what \\nhappened in the city of Sumgait. Every day: my father, and the death of my \\nfather, and how we fought, and the people   orrow, and e pecially the morgue.\\n\\nI  till want to  ay that 70 year  have pa ed  ince Soviet power wa \\ne tabli hed, and up to the very la t minute we could not conceive of what \\nhappened  in Sumgait. It will go down in hi tory.\\n\\nIm particularly  urpri ed that the mob wa nt even afraid of the troop . They\\neven fought the  oldier . Many  oldier  were wounded. The mob threw fuel \\nmixture  onto the armored per onnel carrier ,  etting them on fire. They \\nwerent afraid. They were  o  ure of their impunity that they attacked our \\ntroop . I  aw the cla he  on February 29 near the airline ticket office, right\\nacro  from our building. And that mob wa  fighting with the  oldier . The \\ninhabitant  of  ome of the building , al o Azerbaijani , threw rock  at the \\n oldier  from window , balconie , even cinder block  and gla  tank . They \\nwerent afraid of them. I  ay they were  ure of their impunity. When we were \\nat the neighbor  and when they were robbing home  near the airline ticket \\noffice I called the police at number 3-20-02 and  aid that they were robbing \\nArmenian apartment  and burning home . And they told me that they knew that \\nthey were being burned. During tho e day  no one from the police department \\ncame to anyone  aid. No one came to help u , either, to our home, even though\\nperhap  they could have come and  aved u .\\n\\nA  we later found out the mob wa  given free vodka and drug , near the bu  \\n tation. Rock  were di tributed in all part  of town to be thrown and u ed in \\nfighting. So I think all of it wa  arranged in advance. They even knew in \\nwhich building  and apartment  the Armenian  lived, on which floor --they had\\nli t , the bandit . You can tell that the \"operation\" wa   planned in advance.\\n\\nThank , of cour e, to our troop , to the country  leader hip, and to the\\nleader hip of the Mini try of Defen e for helping u , thank  to the Ru ian\\npeople, becau e the majority of the troop  were Ru ian , and the troop  \\n uffered lo e , too. I want to expre  thi  gratitude in the name of my \\nfamily and in the name of all Armenian , and in the name of all Sumgait\\nArmenian .

Tho e  cholar  did indeed have an excellent\\nrea on to a ume that the  uicide wa   ucce ful.  A  I pointed out, I\\nrecently checked  everal Lexicon :\\n\\n\\t\"Greek Engli h Lexicon of the New Te tament,\" Louw and Nida\\n\\t\"Robin on  Greek and Engli h Lexicon of the New Te tament\"\\n\\t\"Greek Engli h Lexicon of the New Te tament,\" Grimm\\n\\t\"Word  tudy Concordance,\" Tyn dale\\n\\t\"A Greek Engli h Lexicon of the New Te tament and other \\n\\t early Chri tian Writing ,\" Bauer-Arndt-Gingrich\\n\\t\"The New Analytical Greek Lexicon,\" Per chbacher\\n\\nA couple  imply  tated \"hanged one elf\", and a couple were more explicit \\nand  tated that \"apacgw\" mean   pecifically \"kill your elf by hanging.\" A\\ncouple al o noted that the meaning of one the root word  for \"apacgw\" i \\n\" trangle, throttle or choke\" (which pretty much invalidate  the guy who\\n ugge ted to David Jo lin that Juda  wa  hung up ide down).  One of the be t\\nreference  though, \"Robin on  Greek and Engli h Lexicon of the New\\nTe tament,\" not only  tated the tran lation, it gave both the root word , the\\nliteral tran lation, related greek word  which u e the  ame root , and al o\\nother pre ented  pecific example  of the word in greek literature (to give\\nfurther context).  \\n\\nThe word \"apagchw\" ha  two root word : \"gchw\" i  the \"to  trangle\" root, and\\nthe root word \"apo\" mean  literally \"away.\" Thi  root word  i  included in\\nword  which denote a tran ition.  It can mean a tran ition in place (eg: the\\ngreek word \"apagello\" mean  to  end a me age).  \"Apo\" can al o denote a\\nchange in  tate and  pecifically the change from life to death.  Robin on\\n pecifically make  compari on to the word \"apokteiuo,\" which mean  \"to kill.\"\\nIn literal meaning the word \"apacgw\" mean  \"to throttle,  trangle to put out\\nof the way,\" and implicitly denote  a change in life  tate (ie: away from\\nlife, to death).  So while the word \"apacgw\" doe  mean \"to hang,\" it\\n pecifically denote  a death a  well.  Thu  Robin on i  quite  pecific when he\\n tate that it mean  \"to hang one elf, to end one  life by hanging.\" He then\\nnote  the the u e of \"apacgw\" in Homer  Ode y 19:230 to denote context.  He\\npre ent  that example of \"apacgw\" a  being u ed to explicitly mean \" uicide by\\nhanging.\" Now  ince there i  a perfectly good word for  trangling, without the\\nadded denotation of \"death,\" and a  you in i t that the Bible wa  written by\\nGod, and every word i  precicely correct, you are  tuck with the complete\\nmeaning of \"apacgw\" (ie: Since the word \"apacgw\" wa  u ed, then death i \\ndenoted a  the re ult). \\n\\nBy the way, I note that Mr DeCen o al o pre ent  an example of \"apacgw\":\\n\\n> In the Septuagint (the Greek tran lation of the OT u ed at the time of Je u ),\\n> it  only u ed in 2 Samuel 17:23 : \"Now when Ahithophel  aw that hi  advice \\n> wa  not followed, he  addled a donkey, and aro e and went home to hi  hou e,\\n> to hi  city. Then he put hi  hou ehold in order, and hanged him elf, and \\n> died; and he wa  buried in hi  father  tomb.\"   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n> ^^^^ \\n> Notice that not only i  it  tated that Ahithophel \"hanged him elf\" [Gr. Sept.,\\n> APAGCHO], but it explicitly add , \"and died\".  Here we have no doubt of the\\n> re ult.\\n> In Matthew, we are not explicitly told Juda  died.\\n\\nNote Mr DeCen o, a  you  ay, the Septuagint wa  a tran lation from Hebrew to\\nGreek, and you have not  hown the original meaning of the Hebrew (ie\" the the\\nHebrew  ay \"and died\"), and thu  whether it wa   imply echoed in the Greek. \\nIt  hould al o be pointed out that, regardle  of the added \"and died\", the\\ncorrect tran lation would  till be \"apacgw,\" a  the man did indeed die from\\n trangulation (redundant, but correct).  Further, we have evidence that the\\nSeptuagint wa  repeatedly rewritten and reedited (which included ver ion \\nwhich contradicted each other), and  uch editing wa  not even nece arily\\nexecuted by Greek .  Thu  I am not  ure that you can u e the Septuagint a  it\\nnow  tand , a  a paragon of ancient greek.  So, what you really need to prove\\nyour point Mr DeCen o, i  an example, in ancient greek, of  omeone committing\\n\"apacgw\" and  urviving.  Otherwi e I would  ee you a   imply making worthle \\na ertion  without corre ponding evidence. \\n\\nNow I would note Mr DeCen o, that everytime I go out of my way to re earch it\\none of your apparently contrived exegi i , I pretty much find it fal e.  Thu ,\\nI think that if you are going to add to the text,  omething over and above\\nwhat the  ource clearly  ay , then you had better have an explicit Greek or\\nhi torical  ource to ju tify it. \\n\\nBy the way, a  to Mr Ro e   tatement about tree  around the Potter  Field:\\n\\n> There are  till tree  around the ledge  and a rocky pavement at the bottom.\\n\\nUnle  Mr Ro e can  how that the e tree  are two thou and year  old, or that\\nthere are 2000 year old  tump  there, or ha  a 2 thou and year old de cription\\nof the area which mention   uch tree , then it i  inappropriate for him to\\na ert that the pre ent placement of tree  prove the location of the tree  two\\nthou and year  ago (after all, thing  change). \\n\\nNow a  to your other argument, ie: that the money Juda  u ed i  not the  ame\\na  the 30  ilver :\\n\\n> A  to your  econd que tion Mr DeCen o, you a k how we could be  ure that the\\n> money with which Juda  purcha ed the land, wa  indeed for the betrayal, rather\\n> than  ome other  ource.  I would point out that in Act , where it  pecifically\\n> mention \"the reward of iniquity\" [Act  1:18], it al o  pecifically mention \\n> what act of iniquity they were talking about (ie: Act  1:16 \"...concerning\\n> Juda  who wa  guide to tho e who arre ted Je u .\").  Now I would point out\\n> that when the Bible de cribe  an act of \"iniquity,\" and then immediately\\n> di cu e  \"*the* reward of iniquity,\" it would be rather inane to  ugge t that\\n> it wa  an action of iniquity other than the one di cu ed.\"\\n> \\n>  \\n> Notice that in ver e 16, the word \"iniquity\" i  not u ed.  Rather, it  tate \\n> that Juda  \"became a guide to tho e who arre ted Je u \".\\n> But the writer DID NOT  top there...v . 17, \"for he wa  numbered with u  and\\n> obtained a part in thi  mini try.\"  What part did Juda  play in their mini try?\\n>          ^^^^^^\\n\\nTrue, Peter (or the author of Act ) doe  not  pecifically call Juda  betrayal\\n\"an iniquity,\" but for that matter, neither doe  John  pecifically call Juda \\naction  \"an iniquity\" either.  Further John 13:29 did not  ay that Juda  took\\nthe money box, but rather  aid:\\n\\n    \"Some thought that becau e, Juda  had the money box, Je u  wa  telling\\n     him \"Buy what we need for the fea t\"; or that he  hould give  omething\\n     to the poor, So after receiving the mor el he immediately went out, and\\n     it wa  night.\"\\n\\nNote that it i   aid that Juda  left, it doe  not  ay that he took the money\\nbox.  Thu  when I  ee your explanation it  till  eem  to me you would choo e\\nthe a an unproven iniquity, mentioned by another author, in a different\\nbook, written at a different time, over the iniquity explicitly mentioned by\\nthe author of act .  I find thi  forced and contrived. \\n\\nOf cour e thi  particular argument become  moot,  ince we have have  een\\nevidence that \"apacgw\" mean   uicide.  You  ee,  ince Juda  hanging wa \\n ucce ful, he could not have  pent the money mentioned in John 13:29, becau e\\nMatthew and Mark explicitly  ay the betrayal wa  on the high holy day (ie:\\nPa over), and thu  he could not have  pent the money before killing him elf\\nthe next day.  Thu  the money which bought the \"Field of Blood\" would have to\\nhave been the 30 piece  of  ilver (Of cour e he got the 30 piece  of  ilver\\nthat night a  well, and thu  couldnt have  pent that either.  Oh dear, I\\nbelieve that the hou e of card  i  comming down). \\n\\nMaybe we  hould at thi  point, di cu  now whether Je u  wa  crucified on\\nFriday or Saturday a  that i  now part of the argument about Juda .\\n\\nBy the way, a  to where the prophe y of the Potter  field came from (ie: the\\nmention of it in Matthew), you  ay:\\n\\n> Plea e, when we are done with thi   tudy on hi  death, remind me to di cu \\n> thi  with you.\\n\\nI am reminding you now to di cu  it now. It  all part of the  ame ver e we\\nare di cu ing, and I wi h you would quit procra tinating and  ide tepping \\nthe e i ue .\\n \\n\\t\\t\\t\\tLater,\\n\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDave Butler\\n\\n\\tA wi e man proportion  hi  belief to the evidence.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tDavid Hume, Philo opher\\n\\t\\t\\t\\tAn Inquiry Concerning Human Under tanding\\n\\n    PS. I would note again, that you are not  tating that that Bible\\n    i  not po ibly inerrant; you are  tating that it *IS* inerrant.\\n    Since you have been, by your own admi ion, pre enting merely \"po ible\"\\n    reconciliation  (I of cour e dont rate them that highly), then the \\n    be t you can do i   ay that the Bible i  \"po ibly\" inerrant, not that \\n    it *i * inerrant.\\n',\n",
